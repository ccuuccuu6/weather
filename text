2008
Challenging year and strategic reset: The global financial crisis hit in late 2008, causing a sharp decline in beer and soft drink demand in the second half of the year
annualreports.com
. At the same time, Royal Unibrew’s ambitious “Double Up” expansion strategy underperformed – especially in Poland, where expected beer market growth failed to materialize. The company had invested heavily in Polish breweries (four regional breweries acquired in recent years), but weak market growth and a suboptimal product mix led to a large impairment write-down of Polish assets (DKK 455 million)
annualreports.com
annualreports.com
. In response, Royal Unibrew abandoned the aggressive expansion plan and pivoted to restructuring and efficiency measures
annualreports.com
annualreports.com
.
Restructuring and leadership change: Royal Unibrew undertook major cost-cutting in late 2008. It closed the unprofitable Koszalin brewery in Poland, consolidating production at the larger Łomża brewery, and eliminated around 100 jobs in Poland (plus ~100 administrative jobs in Denmark) to reduce costs
annualreports.com
annualreports.com
. In September 2008, CEO Poul Møller resigned after the company issued a profit warning for the year
globenewswire.com
. The Board appointed Henrik Brandt as the new CEO (effective November 1, 2008) to lead the turnaround, signaling a new course focused on core profitability over expansion

.
2009
Turnaround progress: In 2009 Royal Unibrew showed signs of recovery, returning to a modest profit after the previous year’s crisis (profit before tax was DKK 77 million, significantly better than expected)
investor.royalunibrew.com
. The painful restructuring measures begun in 2008 improved the cost base, and the company refocused on its core Nordic, Baltic, and malt beverage markets. While consumer demand was still weak amid the recession, Royal Unibrew managed to defend or slightly grow market shares of its key beer and soft drink brands, benefiting from a more efficient operation.
Debt reduction via divestment: Reducing debt became a top priority in 2009. In August, Royal Unibrew reached a deal to sell its three Caribbean breweries – in Antigua, Dominica, and St. Vincent – to Cerveceria Nacional Dominicana (CND)
globenewswire.com
globenewswire.com
. The sale (completed by year-end 2009) cut the group’s interest-bearing debt by roughly DKK 200 million
globenewswire.com
globenewswire.com
. Royal Unibrew ensured its flagship malt drink Vitamalt would maintain a presence in the region by arranging a license agreement for CND to produce and distribute Vitamalt locally
globenewswire.com
globenewswire.com
. This Caribbean exit freed up capital and management focus for Royal Unibrew’s core European business.
2010
Exit from Poland: In December 2010, Royal Unibrew agreed to sell its entire Polish beer business to Poland’s Van Pur Breweries. This deal saw Royal Unibrew withdraw from direct brewing operations in Poland (which had been a source of losses), in exchange for a minority 20% stake in Van Pur
en.wikipedia.org
. The strategic exit from Poland – after earlier divestments in the Caribbean – marked the completion of Royal Unibrew’s retrenchment from its overextended mid-2000s expansion. The company could now concentrate on its profitable core markets (Denmark, Finland, Italy, the Baltics) and its international malt beverages segment.
Refocusing and recovery: 2010 was a year of stabilization and refocus. With a leaner operation and the troublesome units divested, Royal Unibrew’s financial performance rebounded strongly – the company swung from the large 2008 loss to a healthy profit in 2010 (a turnaround of over DKK 750 million in net result)
research.cbs.dk
research.cbs.dk
. Improved cost control, lower debt, and recovering consumer demand post-recession all contributed. Management (under CEO Henrik Brandt) emphasized strengthening core brands and improving operational efficiency, setting the stage for renewed growth after the tumultuous restructuring period.
2011
Surging input costs: Global commodity prices spiked in 2011, driving up costs for key brewing inputs like barley, sugar, and packaging. By the end of 2011, barley prices had more than doubled (up ~105% from late 2009)
research.cbs.dk
, significantly increasing Royal Unibrew’s raw material expenses. The company responded by hedging raw materials and locking in supply agreements to mitigate the impact
annualreports.com
. Nonetheless, rising input costs put pressure on margins and forced Royal Unibrew (and industry peers) to consider selective price increases to pass on some of the inflation
annualreports.com
.
Eurozone recession hits Italy: Economic turbulence in Europe – particularly the eurozone sovereign debt crisis – affected Royal Unibrew’s export markets. Italy, a key market for the company’s Ceres Strong Ale, entered a recession in 2011 with GDP falling and austerity measures implemented. Italian beer consumption declined amid uncertainty and lower consumer spending
annualreports.com
investor.royalunibrew.com
. Royal Unibrew’s premium brands like Ceres maintained their market share (the brand remained a leader in the Italian super-premium beer segment), but overall volumes in Italy were under pressure. The company increased marketing efforts (“Heroes of Ceres” campaign and social media engagement) to support the brand, even as Italians cut back on on-trade consumption due to economic strains.
Product innovation in the Baltics: Despite challenges elsewhere, Royal Unibrew saw growth opportunities in the Baltics. In 2011, the company launched new beer products (such as two innovative beer concepts, Alfie and Ralph) which met expectations in the market
annualreports.com
. It also acquired the Lithuanian craft beer brand Vilkmerges to enhance its portfolio of local offerings
annualreports.com
annualreports.com
. These moves, along with packaging refreshes (e.g. introducing profiled premium bottles for Lacplesis and Līvu beers in Latvia), helped Royal Unibrew defend or grow its market share in the Baltic countries, which were starting to recover economically.
2012
Challenging summer and taxes: 2012 presented a mixed environment. Northern Europe experienced a poor summer season – unusually cool and rainy weather dampened peak-season sales of beer and soft drinks
annualreports.com
annualreports.com
. Additionally, Denmark implemented an increase in excise taxes (effective January 1, 2012) on soft drinks and beer, which temporarily hit consumption as prices rose
annualreports.com
. Despite these headwinds, Royal Unibrew still managed to grow its net revenue by ~4% for the year
annualreports.com
annualreports.com
. This was achieved by securing new business (notably a private-label production agreement in early 2012 that boosted volumes) and enacting moderate price increases on its branded products to offset higher input costs
annualreports.com
annualreports.com
. While poor summer weather hurt sales, the company’s market share for branded beers and soft drinks actually increased in 2012, indicating strong execution in tough conditions
annualreports.com
annualreports.com
.
New product launches: Royal Unibrew invested heavily in innovation to drive growth. In 2012 it launched Faxe Kondi Booster, a new energy drink extension of its popular lemon-lime soda, which quickly gained distribution and a solid market position
annualreports.com
annualreports.com
. The flagship Royal Beer brand was reintroduced in an elegant new proprietary bottle to enhance its premium appeal
annualreports.com
. The company also expanded its Egekilde bottled water line with vitamin-infused variants, tapping into consumer interest in functional and “better-for-you” beverages
annualreports.com
annualreports.com
. These product innovations, along with focused marketing campaigns and in-store activations, helped Royal Unibrew maintain momentum and compensate for slower industry growth in 2012.
2013
Transformative Hartwall acquisition: A major milestone in 2013 was Royal Unibrew’s agreement to acquire Hartwall Oy, Finland’s second-largest brewery and beverage company, from Heineken. Announced in July and completed in Q4 2013, the Hartwall deal (enterprise value €470 million) instantly expanded Royal Unibrew’s footprint in the Nordics
globenewswire.com
globenewswire.com
. Hartwall brought a portfolio of well-known brands – including Lapin Kulta and Karjala beers, Hartwall Jaffa soft drinks, Novelle waters, and Upcider – as well as a strong distribution network in Finland
globenewswire.com
globenewswire.com
. Importantly, as part of the transaction, Royal Unibrew secured a 10-year licensing agreement with Heineken to brew and distribute Heineken beer in Finland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania (extending Royal Unibrew’s existing license for Denmark)
globenewswire.com
. This acquisition was a strategic game-changer, moving Royal Unibrew from a regional player to a true pan-Nordic beverage group and reinforcing its multi-beverage strategy (combining beer, soft drinks, mineral water, cider, and long drinks).
Strong organic growth boosted by weather: Even before the Hartwall acquisition’s impact, Royal Unibrew enjoyed robust performance in 2013. The summer of 2013 was exceptionally warm and sunny in Northern Europe, which significantly lifted demand for beer and soft drinks
annualreports.com
. Thanks to the favorable weather (and effective sales execution), Royal Unibrew saw higher volumes in its core markets. The company’s Danish business, for instance, experienced a notable uptick during the good summer, helping it regain some market share. Overall, 2013’s organic net sales grew substantially (by ~11% year-on-year)
annualreports.com
, illustrating how both external tailwinds and internal improvements (like better product mix and marketing) contributed to one of Royal Unibrew’s strongest years on record.
2014
Integration of Hartwall and record results: 2014 was focused on integrating the newly acquired Hartwall operations in Finland. Royal Unibrew moved quickly to implement a “change plan” at Hartwall, aligning it with Royal Unibrew’s processes and realizing cost synergies
annualreports.com
globenewswire.com
. The integration progressed positively – efficiency improvements in Finland came faster than expected, contributing to a boost in earnings. By year-end 2014, Royal Unibrew’s EBITDA and cash flow reached all-time highs, largely thanks to the inclusion and successful integration of Hartwall
annualreports.com
annualreports.com
. The strong profit and cash generation enabled Royal Unibrew to reduce the acquisition debt ahead of schedule and even resume shareholder distributions. In August 2014, management raised the earnings outlook for the year, and the Board later announced the reinstatement of dividends and a share buy-back program given the improved financial position
annualreports.com
annualreports.com
.
Favorable conditions and outlook upgrade: External conditions in 2014 were also supportive. Northern Europe enjoyed an extraordinarily good summer weather-wise – much warmer and drier than 2012 and 2013 – which spurred high consumer demand for beverages during the peak season
annualreports.com
annualreports.com
. Additionally, Royal Unibrew managed to hold or grow market share in key markets (e.g. Denmark saw slower-than-feared erosion of Royal Unibrew’s share against the competitor). As a result, Royal Unibrew’s 2014 performance exceeded expectations, with earnings significantly above 2013’s level
annualreports.com
annualreports.com
. Buoyed by this success, the company increased its medium-term EBIT margin target from ~13% to ~14%, reflecting confidence in sustaining higher profitability
annualreports.com
annualreports.com
. Overall, 2014 was a banner year – “earnings and cash flow were the best ever”, as the annual report noted, demonstrating the benefits of the Hartwall acquisition and a generally favorable market environment.
2015
Consolidation and best-ever performance: 2015 was a year of solid execution as Royal Unibrew built on the gains of the Hartwall integration. The company reinforced its market positions across its regions, focusing on core brands and profitable segments. Financially, 2015 turned out to be Royal Unibrew’s strongest year to date, with record earnings and cash flow driven by stable or growing volumes and continued cost efficiencies
investor.royalunibrew.com
. Management highlighted that the group’s “solid market positions and Hartwall integration resulted in the best performance ever” in 2015
annualreports.com
. The balance sheet was further strengthened by reducing net debt (helped by robust free cash flow), giving Royal Unibrew flexibility for future strategic initiatives.
Responding to consumer trends: Royal Unibrew in 2015 began shifting more of its portfolio toward premium and specialty products in response to evolving consumer preferences. The global rise of craft beer and specialty beverages was evident, and Royal Unibrew increased its focus on these categories
investor.royalunibrew.com
. For example, the company laid plans for a new microbrewery facility (completed in 2017) to brew craft and specialty beers in smaller batches, thereby expanding its offerings of unique, local beers
investor.royalunibrew.com
. It also invested in its recently acquired premium brands like Lorina (craft lemonade) and continued innovation in cider and RTD cocktails. This premiumization strategy aimed to improve margins and keep Royal Unibrew relevant to consumers seeking higher-quality or more novel beverage experiences. By the end of 2015, the company had a healthier, more premium-skewed product mix, with brands like Ceres Strong Ale, Faxe Kondi, Vitamalt, and new craft lines supporting a trend of trading consumers up to higher-value offerings
annualreports.com
.
2016
Steady growth and operational focus: 2016 was another good year for Royal Unibrew, marked by continued growth and strong execution. Despite some external challenges (including competitive pressures and currency fluctuations in certain markets), the company managed to increase net sales and profits, extending its track record of improvement
investor.royalunibrew.com
. Royal Unibrew concentrated on its strengths: leveraging a broad portfolio of regional brands, efficient production, and wide distribution. Market conditions were relatively stable – commodity prices for materials like barley and energy were more benign in 2016 compared to the spikes of prior years, which helped ease margin pressures. The company’s focus on cost control and integration efficiencies (post-Hartwall) paid off, as evidenced by further margin improvement. Royal Unibrew also maintained discipline in marketing spend, investing in promotions that drove volume but keeping overall costs in line.
Preparation for leadership transition: As 2016 closed, Royal Unibrew was preparing for a CEO change. The long-serving CEO Henrik Brandt announced plans to retire, and the company’s Board selected a new leader (Lars Jensen was named COO in 2016 as part of succession planning, and Hans Savonije was slated to join as CEO in April 2017
investor.royalunibrew.com
). “2016 was yet another good year for Royal Unibrew” the annual report noted, underscoring that the business was on a solid footing as it headed into this management change
investor.royalunibrew.com
. The groundwork had been laid for the incoming leadership to continue the strategy of organic growth and bolt-on acquisitions.
2017
Leadership change at the top: 2017 saw a handover in Royal Unibrew’s executive leadership. Longtime CEO Henrik Brandt stepped down after nearly a decade at the helm (during which he led the successful turnaround and growth following 2008’s crisis). He was succeeded by Hans Savonije, the company’s COO and Executive Director for Northern Europe, who took over as CEO in 2017
investor.royalunibrew.com
globenewswire.com
. The leadership transition was smooth, as Savonije was a key architect of Royal Unibrew’s strategy and had deep knowledge of the business. Under the new CEO, Royal Unibrew continued its focus on branded beverages and growth in core markets, with no major strategic deviation – though an even greater emphasis was placed on international expansion and M&A.
Acquisition of Lemonsoda (Campari deal): In October 2017, Royal Unibrew announced an agreement to acquire the Terme di Crodo soft drink business from Gruppo Campari in Italy
investor.royalunibrew.com
. This €80 million deal (completed by end of 2017) included the iconic Lemonsoda, Oransoda, and Pelmosoda brands – well-known Italian carbonated soft drinks – as well as the production facility in Crodo, Italy
ansa.it
. The acquisition significantly reinforced Royal Unibrew’s position in Italy
globenewswire.com
, extending its product range beyond beer into non-alcoholics in that market and leveraging Ceres’ distribution network. As part of the transaction, Campari and Royal Unibrew also entered a multi-year manufacturing agreement, under which Royal Unibrew would produce the Campari-owned Aperol Spritz ready-to-drink product at the Crodo plant
borderless.net
ansa.it
. This deal exemplified Royal Unibrew’s strategy of bolt-on acquisitions to grow its multi-beverage portfolio and regional presence.
Product innovation and craft beer focus: Royal Unibrew substantially ramped up new product introductions in 2017, reflecting shifting consumer trends. The craft and specialty beer segment was growing rapidly, and almost every month Royal Unibrew launched or announced a new brew or flavor in this space
annualreports.com
. The company invested in a dedicated craft beer organization and by late 2017 opened a new micro-brewery (at its Albani site in Odense, Denmark) to increase capacity for specialty brews
investor.royalunibrew.com
. It also introduced new lines of pre-mixed cocktails (leveraging its minority stake in Danish cocktail startup Nohrlund) and expanded its cider/RTD offerings. These initiatives tapped into the booming demand for craft beverages and helped Royal Unibrew stay relevant with younger consumers. Overall, 2017 was a year where the company combined internal innovation with strategic acquisition, setting the stage for accelerated growth.
2018
Historic summer drives record sales: The summer of 2018 was one of the hottest on record in Northern Europe, and this weather had a dramatic positive impact on Royal Unibrew’s performance. With prolonged heatwaves, consumers bought significantly more beer, soft drinks, and bottled water, leading to a surge in volume demand
investor.royalunibrew.com
. Royal Unibrew reported that 2018 was its best year ever by earnings – strong execution combined with the extraordinary summer boosted results to new highs
investor.royalunibrew.com
. Both Denmark and Finland saw notable volume increases as people enjoyed the warm weather; even typically soft markets experienced growth. The company’s supply chain managed to meet the spike in demand without major issues, ensuring products were on shelves during the critical peak months. By year-end 2018, Royal Unibrew’s revenue and profit hit record levels, aided by the weather tailwind and solid operational performance.
International soft drinks expansion – Lorina acquisition: In July 2018, Royal Unibrew expanded further into continental Europe by acquiring Etablissements Geyer Frères, a family-owned French beverage company known for its Lorina craft lemonades and other premium soft drinks. Royal Unibrew paid about DKK 660 million for Geyer Frères, gaining 100% ownership of brands like Lorina artisanal lemonade (a top craft soda in France), PureThé organic iced teas, and InFreshhh mixers
investor.royalunibrew.com
beveragedaily.com
. This acquisition gave Royal Unibrew a direct presence in France – a new core market – and tapped into the growing consumer preference for natural, locally produced soft drinks. Lorina’s focus on organic and “craft” positioning complemented Royal Unibrew’s premiumization strategy. Also in 2018, Royal Unibrew integrated the Lemonsoda/Oransoda business acquired from Campari (the deal closed in early January 2018). The Italian soda brands contributed to growth in the non-alcoholic segment and strengthened the company’s multi-beverage profile in Europe. By the end of 2018, Royal Unibrew’s portfolio was notably broader geographically (Nordics, Baltics, Italy, France) and category-wise (beer, malt drinks, soft drinks, energy drinks, cider, RTD cocktails), which reduced reliance on any single market.
2019
Portfolio diversification through acquisitions: Royal Unibrew continued its M&A activity in 2019 to bolster growth and category breadth. Key transactions included:
Denmark (energy drinks/RTD): The company completed the acquisition of Bev.Con ApS – owner of the CULT brand portfolio – after the Danish Competition Authority approved the deal in early 2019
investor.royalunibrew.com
investor.royalunibrew.com
. This brought in CULT Energy (an energy drink), SHAKER (ready-to-drink canned cocktails), and MOKAÏ (flavored cider) brands, reinforcing Royal Unibrew’s position in the fast-growing energy and RTD segments in Scandinavia.
Canada (distribution): In August 2019, Royal Unibrew acquired Bruce Ashley Group (BAG) in Canada
royalunibrew.com
. BAG is an import/export and distribution company that had been Royal Unibrew’s partner for selling products like Heineken and specialty beers in Canada. Bringing BAG in-house (for a purchase price of ~DKK 10 million
ca.marketscreener.com
) gave Royal Unibrew a direct foothold and platform in the North American market, improving control over its brand representation and opening opportunities to expand sales of its beverages in Canada
investor.royalunibrew.com
.
Baltics (craft beer): In November 2019, Royal Unibrew acquired Bauskas Alus, a regional brewery in Latvia known for craft and traditional beers
annualreports.com
. This move expanded Royal Unibrew’s share in the Latvian beer market and added local craft credentials (Bauskas is a heritage brewery dating to 1981, popular for its unpasteurized lagers and kvass). The acquisition complemented the company’s existing operations (Cido juice and Lāčplēša/Livu beers) in the Baltic area.
Stable performance in a normalized year: After the exceptionally strong 2018, the year 2019 had more typical conditions (no repeat of the extreme summer). Organic volume growth was modest, but Royal Unibrew managed to keep revenue growing through a combination of small price increases, innovation, and the contribution of acquisitions. The company introduced new flavors and limited editions (e.g., seasonal craft brews, new Faxe Kondi variants) to stimulate consumer interest. In Western Europe, market growth was flat, but Royal Unibrew’s brands generally held share. One notable challenge was in the second half of 2019, some European retailers engaged in inventory destocking due to uncertainty around Brexit and economic outlook, which tempered orders. Even so, Royal Unibrew delivered solid financial results and closed out the decade in a much stronger position than it began – with a diversified business and multiple growth engines. By the end of 2019, management highlighted that Royal Unibrew had “almost doubled in size” over the past five years and was entering 2020 with optimism and a more balanced portfolio

.
2020
Pandemic disruption and resilience: The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 brought unprecedented challenges. Government lockdowns and restrictions in the spring forced pubs, bars, restaurants, and entertainment venues to close for extended periods, effectively shutting down the on-trade channel in many of Royal Unibrew’s markets
investor.royalunibrew.com
. This led to a sharp drop in keg beer and draft sales. However, a significant portion of the lost on-trade volume shifted into off-trade (retail) as consumers stocked up on drinks to consume at home
gurufocus.com
. Royal Unibrew’s multi-beverage portfolio (including beers, ciders, soft drinks, and RTDs) and strong presence in supermarkets enabled it to capture much of this at-home consumption. The company quickly adjusted its operations – re-routing keg beer originally for bars into can/bottle formats, focusing sales efforts on off-premise outlets, and right-sizing production. Additionally, Royal Unibrew implemented cost-saving initiatives (e.g., cutting travel, marketing events, and other discretionary spend) to protect profitability during the worst of the crisis. By summer 2020, restrictions eased somewhat and on-trade sales partially rebounded (especially in Denmark and Finland), although nightclubs and festival events remained very limited.
Record earnings and new CEO: Despite the turmoil, Royal Unibrew demonstrated remarkable resilience – so much so that it ended 2020 with its highest EBIT ever, even above 2019’s result
via.ritzau.dk
. This outcome was driven by the strong off-trade performance, effective cost management, and the inherent flexibility in Royal Unibrew’s model. The ability to pivot between product categories and channels (for instance, focusing on take-home multi-packs of beer and sodas) helped offset the on-trade losses. The year also saw a leadership change: Lars Jensen (previously COO) was appointed CEO, effective 1 September 2020, succeeding Hans Savonije
inside.beer
. The timing coincided with the pandemic’s second phase; Jensen’s mandate was to steer Royal Unibrew through the COVID recovery and continue its growth trajectory. Under his leadership, the company maintained its strategic direction and even pursued new opportunities (albeit with caution due to pandemic uncertainties). Royal Unibrew’s performance in 2020 underscored its fundamental strength and adaptability in the face of a global crisis.
2021
Post-lockdown rebound and acquisitions: With vaccines rolling out and restrictions lifting, 2021 saw a strong rebound in beverage consumption, especially in the on-trade segment. Bars, restaurants, concerts, and sports events gradually reopened, leading to pent-up demand for beer and soft drinks in social settings. Royal Unibrew’s volumes bounced back notably in the on-trade during summer 2021, though some markets experienced a slower recovery due to lingering COVID measures. Capitalizing on improving conditions, Royal Unibrew also executed several major acquisitions in 2021 to fuel growth:
It agreed to acquire Solera Beverage Group, a leading independent distributor of beers, wines, spirits, and soft drinks across the Nordic countries (with strong presence in Norway, Sweden, and Finland). The deal, completed in late 2021, gave Royal Unibrew a direct route-to-market for a wider range of beverages and added a portfolio of agency brands, strengthening its position in the distribution value chain
globenewswire.com
.
In Q3 2021, Royal Unibrew acquired MC Energy (owner of the Crazy Tiger energy drink brand) in France
investor.royalunibrew.com
. Crazy Tiger is a popular energy drink in the French market, and this acquisition (a follow-up to 2018’s Lorina purchase) further solidified Royal Unibrew’s foothold in France and its share of the energy/functional drinks category.
Royal Unibrew also increased its stake in the Danish craft cocktail company Nohrlund (having initially invested in 2020) and by mid-2022 would own it outright
mainsights.io
. This move, although finalized in 2022, was part of the 2021 focus on ready-to-drink cocktails – an emerging trend.
These acquisitions, along with smaller ones, contributed to Royal Unibrew’s growth. By expanding both geographically and in product range, the company effectively set the stage for about half of its growth from 2021 onward to come from acquisitions
royalunibrew.com
. (Notably, one planned acquisition – Danone’s Aqua d’Or mineral water business in Denmark – was announced in November 2021 but later canceled in 2022 after regulatory scrutiny
globenewswire.com
, so Royal Unibrew did not end up adding Aqua d’Or to its portfolio.)
Strong performance and integration: Financially, 2021 was a very robust year for Royal Unibrew. The combination of organic recovery and acquired growth led to double-digit increases in revenue. The company noted that it entered 2022 as a stronger company, having “expanded our geographic footprint, strengthened most of our market positions and even added new market leading brands” during 2021
investor.royalunibrew.com
. The focus at year-end shifted to integrating the new businesses (Solera, Crazy Tiger, etc.) and extracting synergies. Royal Unibrew’s multi-beverage model again showed its value – for example, Solera’s distribution network in Norway could be used to introduce Royal Unibrew’s own products (like Faxe or Lorina) more widely, and vice versa Solera’s imported brands could gain from Royal Unibrew’s production and marketing expertise. In summary, 2021 was marked by a return to growth mode for Royal Unibrew, with aggressive strategic moves ensuring that the company exited the pandemic period larger and more diversified than ever.
2022
Inflation and war-related pressures: The year 2022 brought new macroeconomic challenges. The Russia–Ukraine war (February 2022) and the ensuing energy crisis and supply disruptions led to a spike in costs for raw materials, packaging, and transportation. Prices of brewing inputs such as barley, glass, aluminum, and CO<sub>2</sub> gas rose sharply to multi-year highs
investor.royalunibrew.com
. Energy costs (natural gas, electricity), vital for brewing and bottling, also surged in Europe. These inflationary pressures squeezed industry margins and forced Royal Unibrew to implement multiple rounds of price increases across its markets in 2022 and early 2023
just-drinks.com
. The company was cautious to balance pricing with consumer affordability, but by the end of 2022 its products were, on average, ~12–15% higher in price compared to 2021
just-drinks.com
. Despite higher prices, consumer demand remained resilient for Royal Unibrew’s beverages in most regions – beer and soft drinks often exhibit inelastic demand, and while there was some trading down to cheaper products in a few markets, Royal Unibrew managed to maintain volumes reasonably well. However, organically the group saw a small volume decline (approx. –3% for the full year) as poor summer weather in parts of Northern Europe and some post-COVID normalization hit sales
investor.royalunibrew.com
. To protect profitability, Royal Unibrew intensified cost optimization, and by sourcing alternatives and efficiency improvements it partially offset the inflation impact.
Strategic acquisition in Norway: In 2022, Royal Unibrew completed a significant deal by acquiring the remaining 75% of Hansa Borg Bryggerier in Norway (Royal Unibrew already owned 25% since 2018). This transaction (enterprise value ~NOK 3.3 billion) gave Royal Unibrew full ownership of Norway’s second-largest brewery group
investor.royalunibrew.com
foodbev.com
. Hansa Borg produces popular Norwegian beer brands like Hansa, Borg, and CB, as well as cider and soft drinks, and it has an extensive distribution network in Norway. Gaining 100% control allowed Royal Unibrew to consolidate Hansa Borg’s results and fully integrate its operations. The move significantly strengthened Royal Unibrew’s position in the Nordic region, making it a leading player in Norway to complement its strongholds in Denmark, Finland, and the Baltics. Integration efforts were launched to achieve synergies in procurement, production, and innovation across the Nordic businesses. By combining Hansa Borg and Solera (the distribution arm acquired in 2021), Royal Unibrew now had a powerful platform in Norway covering both manufacturing and distribution.
Continued growth amid uncertainty: Even with the headwinds of 2022, Royal Unibrew managed to grow its top-line (net revenue) by a considerable margin, thanks largely to acquisitions and pricing. The company’s revenue nearly doubled from 2020 to 2022 (through a mix of M&A and organic gains)
attachment.news.eu.nasdaq.com
, underscoring that it emerged from the pandemic in a far larger form. Profitability was challenged by the cost inflation, but through pricing and cost control, Royal Unibrew maintained solid earnings. The company entered 2023 with cautious optimism: its priorities were to fully integrate recent acquisitions (Solera, Hansa Borg, etc.), continue passing through cost increases appropriately, and ensure it remained agile in the face of any further economic volatility.
2023
Major move in the Netherlands (Vrumona acquisition): In mid-2023, Royal Unibrew announced another transformative acquisition – an agreement to buy Vrumona BV from Heineken
reuters.com
. Vrumona is the second-largest soft drinks player in the Netherlands, known for producing and distributing brands like Pepsi, 7UP, Royal Club, Sisi, and Sourcy (Heineken’s franchised and own soft drink brands). The deal, valued at €300 million, gives Royal Unibrew a significant entry into the Dutch market and greatly expands its soft drink business in Western Europe
marketscreener.com
. Vrumona comes with a state-of-the-art bottling facility and a long-term license relationship with PepsiCo (for the Dutch Pepsi/7UP rights), which aligns with Royal Unibrew’s experience (the company already bottles PepsiCo products in the Nordics)
globenewswire.com

. The acquisition closed later in 2023 after regulatory approvals, adding roughly 2.0 million hectoliters of volume on an annual basis. This marked one of Royal Unibrew’s largest acquisitions ever outside Scandinavia and is a key step in its strategy to become a broader European beverage group.
Mixed market conditions and price adjustments: 2023 proved to be a mixed year operationally. A cool and wet summer in Northern Europe (especially compared to the heatwaves of 2018 and 2022) depressed peak-season sales in some core markets, and retailers in certain areas reduced inventories (destocking) as consumer demand normalized post-pandemic

. As a result, Royal Unibrew’s organic volumes saw a slight decline (about –3% for FY 2023), though total volumes still grew +5% thanks to acquisitions like Hansa Borg and others

. Meanwhile, consumer inflation remained high, and Royal Unibrew implemented further price increases to cope with elevated costs. By the end of 2023, the company’s average pricing was roughly 12–15% higher than pre-inflation (2021) levels

. These price hikes helped defend margins but also tested consumer price sensitivity. The CEO noted that additional price actions were taken in early 2023 to offset input cost inflation, but by late 2023 inflation was easing and price levels were expected to stabilize

. Despite the challenges, Royal Unibrew managed to deliver growth in revenue and maintained healthy profitability in 2023. Over the four-year span since 2019, the company nearly doubled in size (through both organic growth and acquisitions) and demonstrated resilience, emerging as a much stronger and more geographically diversified company

2024
Focus on integration and organic growth: As of 2024, Royal Unibrew is concentrating on digesting its rapid expansion and delivering organic growth from its enlarged platform. The priority is to integrate recent acquisitions – such as Vrumona in the Netherlands and Hansa Borg in Norway – to realize synergies in procurement, distribution, and innovation across countries. Early 2024 results show the impact of these acquisitions: for example, in Q1 2024 group volumes jumped +32% year-on-year, primarily due to the inclusion of Vrumona’s soft drink volumes

. Excluding M&A, underlying organic growth is modest, reflecting a more normalized post-COVID market and some lingering consumer caution. The company is leveraging its now Pan-European scale to share best practices and optimize its brand portfolio (e.g., introducing successful products from one market into new markets via its expanded distribution network).
Innovation and evolving consumer trends: Royal Unibrew in 2024 continues to adapt to shifting consumer preferences. There is increasing demand for low-alcohol and alcohol-free beers, as well as healthier beverages with less sugar or added functional benefits. Royal Unibrew has been innovating in these areas – for instance, extending its line of alcohol-free beers (under brands like Albani 0.0 and Lapin Kulta Zero), and launching flavored sparkling waters and energy drinks with natural ingredients. The company’s strategic focus is on maintaining robust volume and market share even in uncertain macro conditions, which it has largely achieved (sales volumes have remained resilient despite macro uncertainty according to its guidance)

. In 2024, although cost pressures are easing relative to the prior two years, Royal Unibrew is mindful of consumers’ wallet pressures from inflation. Marketing efforts emphasize the value of its core brands, and cost discipline remains in place to guard margins. Overall, Royal Unibrew enters the mid-2020s as a significantly larger, more diversified beverage group, well-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities while navigating economic ups and downs.
