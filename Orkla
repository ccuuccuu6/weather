Orkla Group Timeline (2007–2024)
2007
Expansion and Strategic Investment: Orkla expanded its international footprint by acquiring MTR Foods in India, a move aimed at leveraging India as a future growth platform for its branded consumer goods business
orkla.com
. In the same year, Orkla became the largest shareholder in Renewable Energy Corporation (REC) (taking a ~40% stake), signaling a strategic investment into the booming solar energy sector alongside its traditional industries

.
Robust Markets and Early Cost Pressures: The global economy was strong in 2007, which supported consumer demand in Orkla’s core Nordic and European markets. However, the period also saw rising commodity prices (e.g. for food inputs and packaging), and Orkla began laying the groundwork to mitigate these pressures through product innovation and cost efficiency. This focus on innovation and efficiency would prove crucial as input cost inflation intensified in subsequent years

2008
Weathering the Financial Crisis: The global financial crisis hit Orkla’s broad portfolio. Weakening markets led to a sharp drop in Orkla’s investment values, prompting substantial write-downs of its share portfolio and other assets
mb.cision.com
. Orkla responded with vigorous cost-cutting, cash flow protections, and strict capital controls to safeguard the company amid the downturn

.
Record Branded Goods Performance: Despite the turbulence, Orkla’s Branded Consumer Goods segment had its best-ever year in 2008. The division achieved strong results by launching new products and executing cost improvements (including price increases) to offset soaring raw material costs, such as higher food and energy prices
mb.cision.com
. These efforts enabled Orkla Brands to grow profits even as the broader economy faltered.
Portfolio Restructuring: Orkla undertook significant structural moves. It gained full control of Sapa (its aluminium extrusion business) by acquiring Alcoa’s stake, while simultaneously exiting a joint venture with Alcoa in Elkem Aluminium
mb.cision.com
. This swap simplified Orkla’s portfolio and gave it strategic control over Sapa’s operations. At the same time, Orkla continued to invest in future growth areas – for example, REC (solar) expanded its production capacity and the new Elkem Solar silicon plant was completed, ready to ramp up output in 2009
mb.cision.com
.
Efficiency Measures: Across its businesses, Orkla intensified productivity programs in response to the crisis. The company accelerated ongoing improvement initiatives (begun in 2006) to trim costs and improve operational efficiency. These measures helped Orkla adapt to lower demand and prepared its factories and workforce for the lean environment at the start of 2009

2009
Gradual Recovery and Strong Brands: As the worst of the financial crisis passed, Orkla experienced a gradual recovery in demand. Its Orkla Brands division continued to deliver profit growth, fueled by strong local brand positions and the benefits of extensive improvement programs put in place earlier
mb.cision.com
mb.cision.com
. The company was able to implement selected price increases to counter higher input costs (like sugar and agricultural products), and it benefited from consumers gravitating towards familiar, trusted brands during the recessionary climate.
Challenges in Industrial Segments: Orkla’s more cyclical businesses (notably aluminium and materials) faced a very tough year. The global aluminum market was at a low point in early 2009, hurting Sapa’s volumes and necessitating further cost cuts and capacity adjustments. Nonetheless, Sapa leveraged internal improvements to increase profitability by year-end, and signs of market stabilization began to appear as 2009 progressed

. Likewise, Orkla’s remaining specialty materials unit (Elkem Solar/REC) confronted oversupply and low prices, prompting Orkla to reassess its heavy investments in the solar sector.
Focus on Core and Cash Flow: Throughout 2009, Orkla management prioritized cash flow and operational efficiency. Strict working capital management and reductions in capital expenditure helped maintain a solid financial position
mb.cision.com
mb.cision.com
. This disciplined approach left Orkla well-positioned to capitalize on the economic upturn heading into 2010, with its core branded consumer businesses emerging relatively stronger (and gaining market share) during the downturn.
2010
Record Branded Goods Results: Orkla’s Branded Consumer Goods businesses achieved record performance in 2010, reflecting a post-crisis rebound and successful execution of strategy. Orkla Brands (foods, snacks, personal care, etc.) delivered its highest-ever profit to date, supported by both organic growth and recent acquisitions
annualreports.com
. The company saw increased sales and market share in its core Nordic markets, thanks to a pipeline of new product launches and effective marketing of its strong local brands.
Bolt-on Acquisitions: In line with its strategy to strengthen core areas, Orkla completed 11 acquisitions in 2010 (~NOK 1 billion in value) within its existing geographies
annualreports.com
. These bolt-on acquisitions spanned categories like food and personal care, and they bolstered Orkla’s portfolio of local brands. The added companies – ranging from small Nordic food producers to personal care and houseware brands – helped Orkla expand into adjacent categories and deepen its presence in the Nordics.
Strategic Refocusing – Exit from Elkem: Orkla took a decisive step to refocus on branded goods by agreeing to sell Elkem, its energy-intensive metals and solar materials division. In late 2010, Orkla announced the sale of Elkem (excluding the aluminium extrusion part) to China National Bluestar, citing the need for Elkem to have access to more capital and Asian growth opportunities
annualreports.com
annualreports.com
. This sale (completed in 2011) freed up substantial capital for Orkla and marked the beginning of an exit from highly capital-intensive industries. Orkla reallocated the proceeds to develop its branded consumer goods and other areas with higher long-term value potential.
Portfolio Streamlining: Concurrent with selling Elkem, Orkla took further steps to simplify its portfolio. It reduced its exposure to the solar industry by planning the divestment of Elkem Solar and evaluating its large stake in REC, which had not delivered satisfactory returns
annualreports.com
. Orkla’s leadership affirmed that, going forward, the group would concentrate resources on businesses with strong cash flow and competitive advantages in branded consumer goods (and selected industrial niches like Sapa). These moves were early signals of Orkla’s shift toward a more focused conglomerate, emphasizing operational development of a narrower set of businesses.
2011
Pivot to Branded Consumer Goods: 2011 was a turning point in Orkla’s strategy. The company formally announced that it would concentrate on branded consumer goods as its core business, and would gradually divest non-core operations
s29.q4cdn.com
. This meant Orkla planned to phase out or sell its stakes in businesses like REC (solar energy), Borregaard (chemicals), and even Sapa (aluminium) in the coming years, while also winding down its substantial financial investment portfolio. The vision, communicated at Orkla’s Investor Day in September, was to become a more focused branded goods company, building on Orkla’s strong local brands in the Nordics and leveraging M&A to grow in selected categories and geographies
s29.q4cdn.com
.
Major Divestments Begin: Acting on this strategy, Orkla executed significant divestments in 2011. Notably, it sold Elkem to China Bluestar (a deal agreed at the end of 2010 and closed in 2011), marking Orkla’s exit from the silicon materials business
s29.q4cdn.com
. Additionally, Orkla started a large-scale sell-down of its share portfolio and financial assets – by the end of 2011, the company had divested approximately NOK 20 billion worth of shares and non-core assets since the strategy shift began in late 2010
s29.q4cdn.com
. This included reducing equity positions unrelated to branded goods and freeing capital for core business expansion.
Industrial Operations – Mixed Fortunes: Orkla’s remaining industrial units had mixed performance. Sapa (Aluminium Solutions) faced headwinds from a weak economic outlook in Europe in 2011, but still managed profitable growth in North America and even pursued expansion in Asia (including acquisitions and a joint venture with China’s Chalco to produce profiles for high-speed trains)
s29.q4cdn.com
. Borregaard (Specialty Chemicals), still part of Orkla in 2011, achieved record-high operating profit thanks to favorable markets and internal improvements in efficiency and innovation
s29.q4cdn.com
. These results made Borregaard an attractive candidate for a standalone future (indeed, plans for a Borregaard IPO were in motion by year-end).
Resilient Branded Goods and M&A Pipeline: Orkla’s branded consumer goods business continued to perform solidly in 2011, showcasing the competitive edge of its multi-local model (strong local brands and local operating autonomy) in fending off both international competitors and private labels
s29.q4cdn.com
. Orkla also observed that many branded goods companies (in the Nordics and other markets it operates in) were coming up for sale, often from private equity owners looking to exit
s29.q4cdn.com
. This presented a growth opportunity: Orkla signaled it would seek accretive acquisitions of companies/brands with leading positions and stable cash flows. Indeed, late in 2011 Orkla moved to negotiate major acquisitions (foreshadowing deals like Jordan and Rieber & Søn which were struck in 2012).
2012
Organizing for Core Business: In 2012, Orkla undertook important structural changes to solidify its focus on branded consumer goods. It redesigned its organization by grouping its myriad branded companies into five new business areas: Orkla Foods, Orkla Confectionery & Snacks, Orkla Home & Personal (later Orkla Care), Orkla International, and Orkla Food Ingredients
prod.orkla.webcore.no
. This reorganisation (effective from 2013) was aimed at achieving more homogeneous strategies and synergies within each segment (e.g., grouping all food companies together) while retaining a multi-local approach. It was a major step in simplifying the group’s structure to support its branded goods strategy.
Major Acquisitions – Rieber & Søn and Jordan: Orkla made headline acquisitions to bolster its branded portfolio. In August 2012, it agreed to purchase Rieber & Søn ASA, a Norwegian-listed branded foods group, in a NOK 6.1 billion deal
investors.orkla.com
investors.orkla.com
. Rieber & Søn brought in well-known brands like Toro (soups and sauces in Norway), Vitana (foods in Czech Republic), Delecta (desserts in Poland), and others, significantly strengthening Orkla’s position as the leading Nordic food manufacturer and expanding its reach in Central Europe and Russia
investors.orkla.com
investors.orkla.com
. Earlier in 2012, Orkla also completed the acquisition of Jordan (a Nordic personal and home care products company known for toothbrushes and cleaning supplies) – Jordan’s operations were integrated into Orkla’s Home & Personal care business by the start of 2013
prod.orkla.webcore.no
. These acquisitions underlined Orkla’s commitment to grow its Branded Consumer Goods segment through M&A in core categories.
Exiting Chemicals and Joint-Venture in Aluminium: Orkla continued to exit non-core areas. In October 2012, it carried out an IPO of Borregaard ASA, its specialty cellulose and lignin chemicals business, on the Oslo Stock Exchange
prod.orkla.webcore.no
. The IPO was successful (Orkla’s stake sale raised around NOK 1.7 billion) and by year-end Orkla retained only 19% of Borregaard, with plans to divest that too in 2013
prod.orkla.webcore.no
. Additionally, Orkla drastically changed its involvement in aluminium: it struck an agreement with Norsk Hydro ASA to merge Orkla’s Sapa Profiles and Building System units with Hydro’s extrusion division, creating a new Sapa joint venture owned 50/50 by Orkla and Hydro
prod.orkla.webcore.no
prod.orkla.webcore.no
. As part of this deal, Orkla received a cash compensation of NOK 1.8 billion to account for differences in size, and effectively moved its aluminium extrusion business into a JV (the transaction closed in 2013). This meant Orkla could de-consolidate a large, capital-intensive business, consistent with its strategy. Orkla also initiated a sale process for its remaining Heat Transfer (rolled aluminum) business in late 2012
prod.orkla.webcore.no
 (this unit would later be spun off as Gränges in 2014).
Portfolio Optimization: Within its branded goods empire, Orkla took measures to optimize and concentrate on priority categories. For instance, it merged its Swedish food subsidiaries Abba Seafood and Procordia Food into a single company, making it one of Sweden’s largest food companies
prod.orkla.webcore.no
. This internal consolidation, along with plans for integrating Rieber & Søn, aimed to create scale efficiencies in production, sales and distribution. Orkla was preparing to reap cost synergies from these combinations in the coming years. By the end of 2012, the groundwork was laid for Orkla to enter 2013 as a more focused branded consumer goods company – with legacy industrial holdings either sold, listed, or in joint ventures, and a robust pipeline of new brands from recent acquisitions.
2013
Integration of Rieber & Søn: A key highlight of 2013 was the completion of the Rieber & Søn acquisition. The deal was closed in April 2013, after approval from competition authorities
mb.cision.com
. Orkla immediately began integrating Rieber’s operations: this added strong brands like Toro (Norway), Vitana (Czech Republic), K-Salat (Scandinavia), Frödinge (Sweden), and others into Orkla’s Foods portfolio
investors.orkla.com
. By combining these with Orkla’s existing businesses, Orkla became the undisputed leading branded food products supplier in the Nordics and also gained a solid foothold in Central Europe and Russia (where Rieber had operations)
investors.orkla.com
. The integration involved merging production where feasible and aligning Rieber’s sales force with Orkla’s, although in the short term Orkla did incur costs related to this integration process.
Completion of Non-Core Exits: Orkla largely wrapped up its divestment program for non-core assets in 2013. It sold off its remaining stakes in Borregaard and REC – by mid-2013, Orkla had divested its last 19% of Borregaard and fully exited REC (whose share price had plunged due to the solar industry downturn)
s29.q4cdn.com
. These sales marked the end of Orkla’s involvement in chemicals and solar energy, respectively. Moreover, the Sapa aluminium JV with Hydro was finalized: the new Sapa AS began operations in 2013, meaning Orkla no longer consolidated that business (now an associate). As a result, by late 2013 Orkla ASA was comprised almost entirely of Branded Consumer Goods companies (plus its minority stakes like Jotun and the Sapa JV), a few real estate and hydropower assets, and a greatly reduced financial investment portfolio.
Operational Challenges and Market Conditions: 2013 was a year of transition and not without challenges. The overall organic growth in Branded Consumer Goods was modest, and Orkla’s operating profit was dampened by certain factors. Notably, the integration of Rieber & Søn came with short-term costs, and there were weak market conditions in parts of Orkla’s footprint – for example, Orkla faced challenging snack and biscuit markets in parts of Europe and a weak performance in Russia, which curbed growth in Orkla Confectionery & Snacks. On the positive side, Orkla’s Orkla Home & Personal (later Orkla Care) and Orkla Food Ingredients units showed improvement, and synergy projects were underway across the group. By Q4, Orkla also initiated restructuring in several divisions to reduce costs. Despite flat overall sales, Orkla managed to maintain stable margins through pricing and cost discipline, and it closed the year with signs of improvement in several areas.
Preparing for New Leadership and Identity: With the major portfolio overhaul largely accomplished, Orkla’s Board looked to new leadership to carry the strategy forward. In late 2013, Orkla announced that Peter A. Ruzicka (a veteran retail executive and Orkla board member) would take over as President and CEO in 2014, succeeding Åge Korsvold. Ruzicka’s mandate was to accelerate organic growth in the branded consumer goods portfolio and continue the M&A-driven expansion. Internally, Orkla also worked on refreshing its corporate identity – aligning all its businesses under a coherent branded platform. Although not yet launched, the company was developing a new Orkla logo and profile (introduced in 2014) to underscore its transformation into a focused branded consumer goods company
orkla.com
.
2014
Renewed Focus under New CEO: Under the new CEO, Peter Ruzicka, Orkla in 2014 concentrated on leveraging its core branded businesses for growth. The company launched a fresh corporate logo and vision to signal its transformation into a pure consumer goods company. Management emphasized organic growth, innovation, and brand-building, while also seeking acquisitions in chosen areas. Orkla’s branded categories (foods, snacks, confectionery, health, home care) generally saw good demand in the Nordics, although there was intense competition from both multinationals and private labels. Orkla responded by investing in marketing for its flagship brands and tailoring products to emerging consumer trends (such as healthier recipes and convenience foods).
Baltic Expansion – Acquisition of NP Foods: A major strategic move was Orkla’s agreement to acquire NP Foods Group of Latvia in August 2014. NP Foods owned some of the Baltics’ best-known consumer brands – including Laima (the iconic Latvian chocolate and confectionery brand), Staburadze (cakes and biscuits), Gutta (juices), among others
investors.orkla.com
investors.orkla.com
. This acquisition nearly doubled Orkla’s sales in the Baltic region, making Orkla one of the largest consumer goods companies in those markets
investors.orkla.com
. It significantly strengthened Orkla’s position in confectionery and snacks in the Baltics and complemented Orkla’s existing Baltic businesses (such as Kalev in Estonia and Spilva in Latvia)
investors.orkla.com
. By acquiring NP Foods, Orkla also gained new technology and product development capabilities in chocolates and biscuits, which it planned to leverage across its wider portfolio.
Exit from Aluminium Rolling – Gränges IPO: Continuing its portfolio focusing, Orkla completed its exit from the aluminium materials business in 2014. In October, Orkla listed Gränges AB – the former Sapa Heat Transfer division that produces rolled aluminum for heat exchangers – on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange
prod.orkla.webcore.no
prod.orkla.webcore.no
. After the IPO, Orkla retained a 31% ownership in Gränges as a financial investment, but operational control was relinquished. This move further solidified Orkla’s transformation, as it freed the group from managing a cyclical, capital-heavy manufacturing unit and allowed Orkla to deploy capital into its branded consumer operations. (Orkla would later divest its remaining Gränges shares entirely by 2016.)
Innovation and Synergy Realization: In 2014, Orkla placed a strong emphasis on innovation to drive organic growth. It rolled out new products across categories – for example, healthier snack options and line extensions of popular brands – and invested in modernizing packaging (with a focus on convenience and sustainability). The company also began to harvest synergies from prior acquisitions: the integration of Rieber & Søn (2013) and Jordan was completed, yielding cost savings in procurement and production. Internally, Orkla initiated a group-wide project to implement a common ERP system and streamline IT across its branded businesses, aiming to improve efficiency in the coming years
annualreport2018.orkla.com
. By the end of 2014, Orkla was a much more focused company: essentially a branded consumer goods firm with leading market positions in the Nordics and a growing presence in the Baltics, Central Europe, and Asia (India).
2015
Strengthening Orkla Care – Cederroth Acquisition: In 2015, Orkla continued to invest in its core categories through acquisitions. A notable deal was Orkla’s purchase of Cederroth, a Swedish-based consumer goods company, which was completed during the year
globenewswire.com
. Cederroth brought in a portfolio of health and personal care products (including wound care brands like Salvequick bandages, skincare, household cleaning, and wellness products) that fit well with Orkla’s Orkla Home & Personal/Care business. The acquisition expanded Orkla’s presence in pharmacies and health retailers across the Nordics and broadened its offering in categories like personal first aid, dietary supplements, and skincare
globenewswire.com
. To meet competition authority conditions in Sweden, Orkla agreed to divest Cederroth’s weight-loss brand Allévo, but retained the rest of the business. This move bolstered Orkla’s position in the Nordic personal care and OTC (over-the-counter) market and added well-known local brands to its stable.
Portfolio Optimization and Minor Divestments: As Orkla focused on core branded goods, it also shed some small non-core assets in 2015. For example, Orkla sold off Orkla Brands Russia (which had been struggling in a tough Russian market) and a few remaining real estate holdings. Moreover, it continued to integrate and streamline operations from its flurry of acquisitions in previous years. By 2015, Orkla had largely completed the integration of NP Foods in the Baltics (acquired 2014) – merging sales forces and optimizing production between NP Foods and Orkla’s existing Baltic units. Orkla’s strategy was to concentrate resources on categories and markets where it had or could achieve leading positions, and to exit marginal ventures.
Innovation and Consumer Trends: In response to evolving consumer preferences, Orkla placed a big emphasis on product innovation in 2015. A growing number of new launches were designed to meet demand for healthier and more sustainable options. For instance, Orkla worked on reducing salt, sugar, and eliminating artificial additives in many of its food products. It also pushed its plant-based food offerings (through brands like Anamma in Sweden, a vegetarian foods line) as interest in meat alternatives began to rise. On the home care side, Orkla introduced eco-friendly household products under brands like Jordan Green Clean (with recycled materials) and ensured its cosmetics and personal care lines followed “free-from” trends (e.g., paraben-free, etc.). These qualitative initiatives, while not immediately reflected in financial metrics, were important for long-term brand strength.
Solid Performance and Sapa Recovery: Despite economic headwinds in Norway (where a sharp oil-price drop led to a mild recession in 2015), Orkla’s branded consumer business showed resilience. The company’s diversified geographic footprint (with strong sales in Sweden, Denmark, Finland and beyond) helped offset any softness in the Norwegian market. At the same time, Orkla’s Industrial & Financial Investments segment saw a notable development: Sapa (the aluminium JV) benefited from improved global demand and had a much better year. After struggling in 2012–2013, Sapa’s extensive restructuring bore fruit; in 2015 Sapa enjoyed higher volumes in North America and Europe and achieved significantly improved profitability
prod.orkla.webcore.no
. This contributed positively to Orkla’s income via its share of Sapa’s profits. By year-end, Orkla’s profile was one of a focused branded goods company with strong cash flows, which it used to both pay stable dividends and reinvest in growth opportunities.
2016
Central European Expansion – Hamé Acquisition: In 2016 Orkla made one of its largest international acquisitions to date by acquiring Hamé, a leading branded food company in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The agreement (announced late 2015) was completed in March 2016
investors.orkla.com
. Hamé has a broad portfolio of food products – including pâtés, ready meals, ketchups, jams, and baby food – with strong local brands (such as Májka, Hamé, and Vitana (Slovakia) in certain categories). By purchasing Hamé, Orkla doubled its turnover in Central Europe, instantly becoming one of the region’s top branded consumer goods companies
annualreport2016.orkla.com
. This move built on Orkla’s earlier entry into Czech/Slovak markets via Vitana (from Rieber & Søn) and gave Orkla a powerful platform for further growth in Eastern Europe. Hamé’s extensive distribution network in its home markets and nearby countries (like Hungary and Romania) also provided Orkla an avenue to introduce more of its product range in those markets.
Growing Orkla House Care – Harris Acquisition: Orkla also expanded its Orkla House Care business internationally in 2016. In May, it agreed to acquire L.G. Harris & Co. (“Harris”), a leading UK manufacturer of paint brushes, rollers and painting tools, which has a history dating back over 50 years
globenewswire.com
. Harris is a market leader in the DIY painting segment in the UK and sells across Europe. This acquisition (completed later in 2016) complemented Orkla’s existing painting tool brands (such as Anza in the Nordics) and effectively made Orkla House Care a European leader in painting accessories. It was a strategic move to grow outside Orkla’s home region in a category where Orkla had specialized expertise. Through Harris and previous acquisitions, Orkla Home & Personal (Care) built a substantial “do-it-yourself” home improvement category, adding a new growth leg to the portfolio.
Complete Exit from Gränges (Aluminium): In 2016, Orkla fully exited Gränges, the aluminium rolling company. After the 2014 IPO, Orkla had gradually reduced its holding and by the first half of 2016 it sold its remaining ~16% stake in Gränges via a market placement
annualreport2016.orkla.com
. This sale yielded a gain and marked the end of Orkla’s direct ownership in any aluminium production. Together with the Sapa sale (which would come in 2017), Orkla was clearly signalling that its era of being a hybrid branded goods and industrial conglomerate was over. Capital from these divestments was earmarked for debt reduction and for reinvestment in the branded consumer goods business.
Continued Portfolio Pruning and Synergies: Alongside big acquisitions, Orkla kept pruning smaller assets. For instance, it divested a few underperforming brands in the Baltics and Scandinavia to local players (where they lacked scale), and continued integrating recent acquisitions to extract synergies. The integration of Hamé with Orkla’s existing Vitana business in Czech/Slovakia was a major project in 2016; plans were drawn to merge operations, unify leadership, and possibly consolidate manufacturing sites. Similarly, Orkla integrated Harris with its Anza painting tools unit to leverage product development and sourcing synergies. By late 2016, Orkla’s portfolio was markedly more streamlined and focused than just a few years prior – the group was now largely composed of branded consumer companies spanning the Nordic region, Baltics, Central Europe, and selected Asian markets, supported by a few investments (Jotun paint and the remaining Sapa JV).
2017
Sale of Sapa to Hydro – Focus on Core Complete: A landmark transaction in 2017 was Orkla’s decision to sell its 50% stake in Sapa to its partner Norsk Hydro. Announced in July and completed in October, this deal valued Sapa (the world’s largest aluminium extrusion company) at NOK 27 billion and resulted in a significant cash inflow to Orkla
annualreport2017.orkla.com
. By selling Sapa, Orkla effectively completed its long-planned exit from the aluminium metals business. This divestment was in line with Orkla’s strategy to concentrate on consumer-oriented brands – it also considerably de-risked the company by removing exposure to a cyclical, industrial sector. The proceeds from the Sapa sale were earmarked for strengthening Orkla’s balance sheet and for potential acquisitions in Branded Consumer Goods. After this sale, Orkla’s only remaining non-core industrial exposure was its minority shareholding in Jotun (paints) and some hydropower assets, meaning Orkla ASA was now overwhelmingly a branded goods and consumer company.
Investment in Digital Commerce – HSNG Acquisition: Orkla also took a strategic step into digital consumer commerce in 2017. In November, Orkla agreed to acquire the Health and Sports Nutrition Group (HSNG) in Sweden, which operates the major e-commerce portals Gymgrossisten and Bodystore
investors.orkla.com
investors.orkla.com
. HSNG is the Nordic region’s largest online retailer of sports nutrition, supplements, and health products. Through this acquisition, Orkla not only entered a high-growth product segment (sports nutrition and wellness) but also gained valuable capabilities in e-commerce and digital marketing – areas that traditional FMCG companies were keen to bolster. Orkla’s management noted that this deal would give it direct access to engaged health-conscious consumers and provide synergies with Orkla’s existing health brands (like Maxim sports nutrition and Nutrilett)
investors.orkla.com
. The HSNG acquisition (completed in early 2018) was a clear sign of Orkla adapting to shifting consumer purchasing habits, complementing its strong position in traditional retail with an online channel presence.
Portfolio Add-ons and Innovations: Throughout 2017, Orkla continued to snap up smaller bolt-on acquisitions in its core categories. For example, it acquired Riemann (manufacturer of P20 sunscreen and skincare products in Denmark) to grow its personal care portfolio, and Agrimex (a Czech frozen vegetable producer) via Hamé to strengthen its food offerings – these smaller deals reinforced Orkla’s positions in chosen niches. On the innovation front, Orkla ramped up new product development, emphasizing healthy and “free-from” foods. It introduced items like Grandiosa gluten-free pizzas in Norway and sugar-reduced snacks under its confectionery brands to address health trends. Orkla also invested in marketing its flagship brands with a focus on their local origin and quality, a strategy to differentiate from both private labels and imports.
Rising Input Costs and Preparations: After several years of benign input cost conditions, global raw material prices started climbing in 2017, especially in the second half. Orkla felt the impact of higher prices for key inputs such as dairy, vegetable oils, and packaging, as well as currency fluctuations (e.g., a weaker Norwegian krone made some imports costlier). The company noted that it was exposed to a broad range of commodities and that supply chain bottlenecks (partly a result of global growth and some lingering effects of weather on crops) were creating cost pressure
investors.orkla.com
. To protect its margins, Orkla began implementing price increases across its product categories and intensified cost-improvement programs. By the end of 2017, Orkla’s CEO cautioned that continued commodity inflation was expected going forward
investors.orkla.com
, and the group prepared contingency plans – such as alternative sourcing and reformulation – to manage these higher costs. Overall, 2017 was a year where Orkla finally shed its conglomerate skin, emerging as a focused branded consumer goods company and simultaneously gearing up to tackle new challenges in the marketplace (digitalization and inflation).
2018
Channel and Category Diversification: In 2018, Orkla pushed further into new channels and product categories to drive growth. It capitalized on the out-of-home food trend by investing in a restaurant business: in April, Orkla acquired a 67% stake in Gorm’s, a Danish pizza restaurant chain known for artisanal pizzas
annualreport2018.orkla.com
. Gorm’s operates in the premium takeaway and casual dining segment, and this gave Orkla Consumer Investments a foothold in the growing foodservice market. Orkla also expanded its Orkla Food Ingredients portfolio by purchasing companies like Werners GourmetService in Sweden (a supplier of premium bakery and dessert ingredients such as truffles, chocolate, and spices)
annualreport2018.orkla.com
. Additionally, Orkla increased its ownership in its painting tools joint venture Anza, taking a 50% stake in January 2018 to strengthen its position in the Benelux painting accessories market
annualreport2018.orkla.com
. These moves illustrate Orkla’s strategy of extending beyond traditional retail products into adjacent businesses like restaurants, specialty ingredients, and services, thereby capturing a greater share of the consumer’s “meal” and DIY value chain.
Digital and Health Integration: Following the late-2017 agreement, Orkla completed the acquisition of HSNG in January 2018, making it a wholly owned unit in Orkla Care
annualreport2018.orkla.com
. HSNG (Gymgrossisten and Bodystore online stores) continued to operate as a separate e-commerce unit, but Orkla leveraged its expertise to boost its existing health brands’ online sales. Orkla also acquired the remaining minority in Proteinfabrikken (a Nordic sports nutrition brand) to own it 100% by the end of 2018, folding it into its health portfolio. These steps underscored Orkla’s commitment to the health and wellness segment and recognition of the shifting retail landscape towards online channels. By integrating digital commerce and specialty health brands, Orkla positioned itself to reach fitness enthusiasts and health-focused consumers more directly.
Mixed Market Conditions – Norway vs. Abroad: Orkla’s organic growth was flat in 2018 (Branded Consumer Goods posted –0.2% organic growth, which was roughly +0.4% when adjusted for lost distribution agreements)
annualreport2018.orkla.com
. This was a tale of two trends: excellent growth in several markets – Sweden, Finland, the Baltics, and India all delivered good sales increases – contrasted with declines in Norway
annualreport2018.orkla.com
. In Norway, a significant factor was the government’s steep increase in the sugar tax (effective January 2018), which led to a sharp drop in volumes for sugary products like sodas, juices, and confections
annualreport2018.orkla.com
. Orkla’s confectionery and snack sales in Norway were hit as consumers cut back or cross-border shopped for cheaper sweets. Additionally, Orkla Health’s Polish business underperformed, adding to the drag

. To counter these issues, Orkla undertook price adjustments and cost cuts. The company also lobbied against the sugar tax, highlighting its impact on domestic industry. Meanwhile, in other markets, Orkla enjoyed robust performance; for instance, in India, Orkla’s MTR Foods saw double-digit growth as it expanded its distribution and launched new product variants for Indian consumers.
Efficiency and Structural Measures: In response to the challenging top-line picture, Orkla accelerated efforts to improve efficiencies and reduce costs in 2018. It initiated or continued factory footprint optimization projects – evaluating plant consolidations in high-cost regions and investing in automation. Several structural measures were implemented, including merging certain production units and outsourcing non-core manufacturing where feasible
annualreport2018.orkla.com
. Orkla also made progress on a major IT initiative: it began rolling out a common ERP platform across Orkla Foods, Confectionery & Snacks, and Care, aiming for completion over 2019–2021
annualreport2018.orkla.com
. This unified system is expected to facilitate better coordination and economies of scale across the businesses. Despite one-off costs, these efficiency moves are essential for Orkla to remain cost-competitive, especially in light of higher raw material and logistics expenses in 2018 (oil prices and some commodity prices rose during the year). By year-end, Orkla’s management reaffirmed the importance of innovation as a “critical success factor” for growth
annualreport2018.orkla.com
 and cited examples like the launch of Jordan Green Clean toothbrushes (eco-friendly design) and new snack products under the OLW/KiMs brands that responded to consumer trends for natural ingredients
annualreport2018.orkla.com
. In summary, 2018 was a challenging year that prompted Orkla to double down on both synergy extraction and innovation, ensuring the company could return to growth in the future.
2019
Growth in New Channels (M&A): In 2019, Orkla continued to expand via acquisitions, with a notable emphasis on the out-of-home and foodservice segment. It acquired Kotipizza Group of Finland, the country’s largest pizza restaurant franchise network, in a deal that complemented Orkla’s existing consumer pizza brands by giving it a foothold in delivery/takeaway restaurants
prod.orkla.webcore.no
. Similarly, Orkla bought Easyfood, a Danish producer of bakery products for convenience and foodservice, and Lecora, a Swedish maker of ready meals for professional kitchens – both moves to strengthen Orkla’s offerings for cafés, restaurants, and canteens
prod.orkla.webcore.no
. These acquisitions reflect Orkla’s strategy to capture growth in channels beyond traditional grocery retail. In the health and wellness arena, Orkla acquired a 43.5% stake in Captain Kombucha (a fast-growing fermented tea beverage brand) and increased its ownership in Nói Síríus (Iceland’s leading chocolate and candy company) to over 90%
prod.orkla.webcore.no
. By taking control of Nói Síríus (having first bought 20% in 2019), Orkla added strong confectionery positions in Iceland and the opportunity to export some niche candy products to other markets.
Sustainability and Plant-Based Momentum: Orkla placed sustainability and health even more at the forefront in 2019. The company saw rising demand for plant-based foods, and its subsidiaries launched new plant-based product lines. For example, Orkla’s Swedish brand Anamma and Danish brand Naturli’ (both specializing in vegan and vegetarian foods) experienced solid growth as consumers looked for meat alternatives
prod.orkla.webcore.no
. Orkla introduced innovations like plant-based mince and burgers under these brands, which were well-received in the Nordic market. The company also increased investments in sustainable packaging and pledged to make all packaging recyclable by 2025. In terms of broader sustainability, Orkla accelerated programs to cut food waste and to source key raw materials (like palm oil, cocoa, and fish) more responsibly, aligning with consumer expectations and its own corporate responsibility goals.
Organic Growth and Brand Investments: Orkla achieved an estimated organic growth of around 2% in its Branded Consumer Goods business in 2019, a notable improvement after the flat performance of 2018
globenewswire.com
. This growth was driven by volume upticks in categories like snacks and confectionery (partly bouncing back as the impact of Norway’s sugar tax normalized), as well as successful new product launches in foods and personal care. Orkla increased its marketing investments, particularly in digital media, to engage younger consumers. It launched a new slogan and vision – “Your friend in everyday life” – to emphasize that Orkla’s local brands are present in consumers’ daily routines with products that meet their needs and desires
prod.orkla.webcore.no
. A highlight of the year was the opening of Orkla’s new headquarters, Orkla House, in Oslo. The state-of-the-art, environmentally friendly office (housing 900 employees) brought many of Orkla’s staff under one roof, fostering collaboration across formerly separate companies and further building a one-Orkla identity in the branded consumer goods realm.
Leadership Change and Strategy Continuity: Mid-2019 saw a leadership transition: Jaan Ivar Semlitsch was appointed the new President and CEO (taking over in August) as Peter Ruzicka stepped down. Semlitsch, coming from a retail background, affirmed that Orkla’s core strategy would remain focused on branded consumer goods, but signaled an increased focus on simplifying Orkla’s portfolio and structure to drive efficiency
prod.orkla.webcore.no
prod.orkla.webcore.no
. In his first months, he initiated organizational changes at the group level to empower the business areas and reduce complexity. Orkla also made tweaks in its reporting structure, preparing to group some smaller units (like Orkla’s remaining investment in Jotun and its hydropower assets) under a clearer “Investments” segment. By the end of 2019, Orkla was in a strong position: it had a broad portfolio of leading local brands, had delivered growth and margin improvement during the year, and was set to carry its strategy into the 2020s with a renewed focus on profitable growth and sustainability.
2020
Pandemic Impact – Surge in Retail, Slump in Out-of-Home: The year 2020 was heavily influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, which dramatically altered consumer behavior and Orkla’s operating environment. Orkla’s primary focus during the crisis was on safeguarding employees (through enhanced health and safety measures) and keeping its supply chain and factories running to ensure product availability
annualreport2020.orkla.com
. Pandemic lockdowns led to major shifts in demand: there was a sharp increase in grocery retail sales as consumers stayed home and cooked more, benefiting Orkla’s food and household product categories. Conversely, the Out-of-Home sector (restaurants, cafés, canteens) saw steep declines, which negatively affected Orkla’s businesses serving those channels. For instance, Orkla Food Ingredients – which supplies bakery ingredients and ice cream components largely to professional outlets – experienced a significant sales drop in the spring of 2020
annualreport2020.orkla.com
. Nevertheless, strong in-home consumption throughout the year meant Orkla’s overall revenues held up well. The Branded Consumer Goods business achieved organic growth of 1.6% for 2020
annualreport2020.orkla.com
, as the surge in retail (supermarket) demand outweighed the out-of-home losses for most of Orkla’s units.
Resilience and Earnings Growth: Thanks to cost control and adaptability, Orkla actually saw its profits improve in 2020. Group EBIT (adjusted) rose ~8%, and Branded Consumer Goods delivered a double-digit percentage improvement in operating profit
annualreport2020.orkla.com
annualreport2020.orkla.com
. Several factors drove this: robust volume growth in groceries (many Orkla food brands like TORO and Abba had higher sales as people cooked at home), a temporary reduction in marketing and travel costs (due to pandemic restrictions), and positive currency translation effects (a weaker Norwegian krone increased the value of foreign earnings)
annualreport2020.orkla.com
. Orkla did face higher costs in areas like logistics and protective equipment, but it implemented efficiencies (e.g., prioritizing core SKUs for production) to mitigate these. Notably, Hydro Power (one of Orkla’s legacy investments) saw a profit decline because of very low power prices in the Nordics in 2020
annualreport2020.orkla.com
, but this had limited impact on group results given its small size. Overall, Orkla showed considerable resilience, navigating unprecedented conditions with “satisfactory performance”
s29.q4cdn.com
.
Pandemic Consumer Trends – Health and Sustainability: The pandemic accelerated certain consumer trends that Orkla was well-positioned to serve. Home baking and cooking boomed – Orkla’s sales of baking ingredients, flour, yeast, and spices surged as households took to the kitchen. Its Orkla Care division saw increased demand for cleaning and hygiene products (e.g., anti-bacterial soaps from Lilleborg) and dietary supplements (consumers seeking health boosters). Orkla also observed heightened interest in healthy and sustainable foods during 2020. Its vegetarian and vegan product lines (like Anamma and NATURLI’ plant-based foods) and newer launches such as Frankful (a brand of plant-based taco ingredients) delivered good growth
annualreport2020.orkla.com
. The company actively promoted these as sustainable choices for everyday life. Orkla’s innovation teams, despite the pandemic, continued to develop new products with a focus on health, convenience, and sustainability – many of which were launched in late 2020 and into 2021. The crisis reinforced Orkla’s strategic direction to offer “sustainable choices for everyday life,” leveraging its local brands to meet evolving needs
annualreport2020.orkla.com
.
Strategic Moves – M&A and Portfolio: Importantly, Orkla did not put its strategic initiatives on hold due to COVID-19. In September 2020, Orkla announced an agreement to acquire a 67.8% stake in Eastern Condiments Pvt Ltd, one of India’s leading spice and food mix companies
annualreport2020.orkla.com
. Orkla already had a presence in India through MTR Foods, and the plan was to merge Eastern with MTR to create a joint entity where Orkla would hold 90%+ ownership. This acquisition (completed in 2021) doubled Orkla’s revenues in India, making it a strong #1 in Indian branded spices and packaged foods
orkla.com
. Additionally, Orkla made smaller acquisitions in 2020: it purchased the Havrefras cereal brands (Rug Fras and Mini Fras) from PepsiCo to strengthen its breakfast portfolio in the Nordics
annualreport2020.orkla.com
, and acquired Norgesplaster, a Norwegian first-aid and wound care company, to reinforce Orkla Care’s pharmacy channel offerings. On the divestment side, Orkla sold off a couple of peripheral brands (for example, the Sarita’s Asian sauce brand was sold to a smaller company
annualreport2020.orkla.com
, and Vestlandslefsa – a Norwegian flatbread brand – was divested, as these were non-core to prioritized categories). These actions show Orkla’s continued commitment to portfolio optimization – even amidst a global crisis, Orkla was forward-looking, expanding in high-growth markets like India and streamlining its product range to focus on what it does best.
2021
Major Acquisitions and Growth Platforms: 2021 was an active year for Orkla’s expansion, as it completed several strategic acquisitions to fuel future growth. In India, Orkla finalized the purchase of Eastern Condiments and merged it with MTR Foods, creating Orkla India as a strong platform with roughly double the revenues in that market
orkla.com
. This move gave Orkla a leading position in Indian spices, curry mixes, and ready-to-eat ethnic foods, significantly expanding its presence in Asia. In the Nordics, Orkla targeted the high-growth health and wellness sector by acquiring NutraQ (agreed in 2021), a Oslo-based company known for subscription-based health supplements and wellness products (including the brands VitaePro and Oslo Skin Lab)
orkla.com
. NutraQ operates in multiple Nordic markets and adds a direct-to-consumer distribution model to Orkla’s capabilities.
Entering New Categories – Pizza and Confectionery: Orkla also ventured further into the foodservice and franchise restaurant business by acquiring a majority stake in New York Pizza in the Netherlands in July 2021
orkla.com
. New York Pizza is a leading pizza delivery and takeaway chain in the Dutch market (with a master franchise model). This acquisition, done via Orkla’s Consumer Investments arm, marked Orkla’s first entry into Western Europe’s restaurant sector and provided a new growth avenue in the convenience dining segment. Additionally, Orkla increased its stake in (and effectively took full control of) Noí Síríus, the Icelandic confectionery manufacturer famous for brands like Sirius chocolate and Opal candies
orkla.com
. Orkla had owned 20% of Noí Síríus since 2019 and in 2021 acquired the remaining shares, integrating this business fully. This bolstered Orkla’s Confectionery & Snacks portfolio and secured the #1 confectionery position in Iceland.
Rebound and Inflation: With the easing of COVID restrictions in 2021, Orkla experienced a rebound in its out-of-home and impulse-driven businesses. Categories that had been depressed in 2020 – such as ice cream ingredients (Orkla Food Ingredients) and snacks consumed on-the-go – saw renewed growth. Notably, Orkla Food Ingredients posted 20% organic growth in Q2 2021 as bakeries, cafes, and ice cream parlors reopened
investors.orkla.com
. Similarly, Orkla’s Consumer Investments (which includes the Kotipizza chain and House Care) enjoyed over 13% organic growth in that period
investors.orkla.com
. Overall, Orkla’s Branded Consumer Goods division achieved about 6–8% organic growth for full-year 2021, a robust recovery aided by volume pick-up and price increases. However, 2021 also brought strong cost inflation globally. Supply chain disruptions, higher commodity prices, and energy costs created a surge in Orkla’s input costs – from edible oils and grains to packaging and transport. By mid-2021, Orkla’s CEO flagged concern about “rising raw material prices” and noted that bottlenecks and increased demand were driving broad-based inflation
investors.orkla.com
. In response, Orkla implemented significant price increases across all markets and categories to protect its margins, and stepped up internal cost-saving projects. The lag effect of cost inflation meant margins were squeezed in some quarters (Orkla’s Q3 results showed margin pressure due to the time gap between cost rise and price hikes), but by the end of 2021 the company was catching up with price adjustments.
Strategic Direction and ESG: During 2021, Orkla continued to refine its strategic direction, preparing for an organizational shift to come (which would be announced in 2022). It also launched group-wide sustainability initiatives, setting targets for 2025/2030 to cut greenhouse gas emissions and use more recyclable packaging. Orkla’s brand companies launched dozens of innovations, many of which were in healthier categories (e.g., sugar-free versions of confections, protein-enriched snacks) or convenience (meal kits and plant-based ready meals). By the end of 2021, Orkla had essentially completed a decade of transformation into a branded consumer goods specialist. The company’s geographical reach now spanned the Nordics, Baltics, Central Europe, India, and parts of Western Europe, and it was active in diverse channels (retail, out-of-home, online). This set the stage for rethinking its corporate structure to support the next phase of growth.
2022
Unprecedented Cost Inflation and Geopolitical Uncertainty: 2022 was a challenging year globally, marked by the outbreak of war in Ukraine and surging inflation, and Orkla was not spared from these macro pressures. The war and associated sanctions caused turmoil in energy and commodity markets, leading to disrupted supply chains and record-high input costs for manufacturing companies
orkla.com
. Orkla faced unprecedented increases in costs for raw materials (such as oils, grains, dairy, and sugar), packaging, and especially energy, since gas and electricity prices in Europe hit historic peaks. Transportation and logistics costs also spiked. Orkla described the situation as input costs reaching levels not seen before, which put heavy pressure on margins
orkla.com
. The company responded with extraordinary efforts: it worked closely with suppliers to secure materials, built up some inventory of critical inputs to ride out shortages, and pushed through multiple rounds of price increases in all its markets to offset the cost escalation
orkla.com
s29.q4cdn.com
. By necessity, consumers saw higher prices on Orkla’s products, though Orkla tried to time and dose these increases carefully to maintain competitiveness. Despite these challenges, Orkla managed to keep its production running without major interruptions, demonstrating the resilience of its supply chain.
Leadership Change and Strategic Overhaul: Amid these external challenges, Orkla underwent a significant leadership and strategic shift in 2022. In April, the Board announced that Nils K. Selte would take over as President and CEO (effective 11 April 2022), succeeding Jaan Ivar Semlitsch
investors.orkla.com
. Nils Selte, previously CEO of Orkla’s principal owner Canica and a former Orkla board member, swiftly initiated a comprehensive review of Orkla’s operating model. By mid-2022, Selte signaled that Orkla would consider streamlining its organization and potentially divesting or restructuring parts of the business
just-food.com
. In a strategic update later in the year, Orkla unveiled plans to transform into a “industrial investment company” structure
orkla.com
. Practically, this meant that Orkla would reorganize its myriad businesses into a set of autonomous portfolio companies, each with more operational independence and its own tailored strategy, while Orkla ASA would act as an active owner (allocating capital and setting performance targets). This new model was aimed at unlocking value by giving business units more flexibility (including opportunities to bring in external investors or partners for joint ventures) and sharpening Orkla’s focus on returns. The decision was influenced by a recognition that Orkla’s conglomerate structure was complex and that some parts of the business were undervalued or could perform better with dedicated focus.
Portfolio Moves – Mergers and Divestments: Orkla continued to fine-tune its portfolio in 2022 in line with its strategic focus. Early in the year, it merged Eastern Condiments with MTR Foods in India as planned, creating one strong Orkla India entity. This integration progressed well, and by combining distribution networks and product portfolios, Orkla aimed to realize synergies and accelerate growth in the Indian market (despite some headwinds from a severe COVID wave in India in early 2022). On the divestment front, Orkla identified certain non-core assets for potential sale. Notably, given high power prices in 2022, Orkla’s Hydro Power business (a collection of hydropower plants in Norway) became very valuable, and Orkla started exploring options to monetize it. By late 2022, Orkla had initiated a process to sell its hydropower assets, reasoning that energy production was not core to its branded consumer mission. (This sale would be agreed in 2023 and completed in 2024–25.) Similarly, Orkla evaluated its ownership in Jotun (the paint company) – though no sale occurred in 2022, analysts speculated Orkla might reduce its 42% stake to free up capital. On the acquisition side, activity was relatively quiet compared to prior years (partly due to high prices and a focus on internal restructuring). One meaningful deal that carried over into early 2023 was Orkla’s agreement (February 2023) to purchase the remaining shares of NutraQ, making it a fully owned subsidiary
annualreport2020.orkla.com
. In summary, Orkla used 2022 to set the stage for a more concentrated and agile corporate structure, even as it managed through an extraordinarily volatile operating environment.
Operational Resilience: Despite the margin pressures, Orkla’s underlying businesses remained operationally resilient in 2022. The company’s local brands often have pricing power, and even though volumes in some categories fell due to higher prices and consumer caution, most Orkla units maintained or grew their market shares. There was particular strength in categories like confectionery and snacks (where consumers tend to stick with familiar comfort brands during uncertain times) and home care products. Orkla also leveraged its innovation pipeline to introduce value-added products that justified higher price points – for instance, launching premium chocolate variants with sustainability certifications, or functional health foods with added benefits. Orkla’s adaptability was also evident in its cost management: it accelerated efficiency programs (optimizing manufacturing footprints and reducing SKU complexity) to take out cost where possible. By year-end 2022, although Orkla’s profits were somewhat muted by the cost shock, the company had preserved a solid financial position and was ready to execute on the bold strategic changes outlined by the new CEO.
2023
New Operating Model – Portfolio Companies: In 2023, Orkla executed the transformative reorganization it had planned. On 1 March 2023, Orkla implemented a new operating model, officially establishing 12 autonomous “Portfolio Companies” under the Orkla umbrella
mynewsdesk.com
. Each portfolio company corresponds to a business unit (for example, Orkla Foods Europe, Orkla Foods Nordic, Orkla Confectionery & Snacks, Orkla Care, Orkla India, Orkla Food Ingredients, Orkla Consumer Investments, etc.), with its own CEO and board. Orkla ASA repositioned itself as an industrial investment company, essentially a holding company that exercises active ownership. This structural shift was one of the most significant changes in Orkla’s corporate history – it aimed to empower the individual businesses to pursue growth and operational improvements with more agility, while Orkla ASA would focus on capital allocation, talent management, and strategic direction
mynewsdesk.com
mynewsdesk.com
. A direct outcome of this model was increased transparency and accountability: Orkla set specific financial targets for each portfolio company and could potentially seek external partnerships or even listings for them if it would enhance value.
Partnerships and Divestments: Embracing its new role as an active investor, Orkla didn’t shy away from bringing in partners for its businesses. In October 2023, Orkla announced that it had agreed to a partnership for Orkla Food Ingredients (OFI): private equity funds affiliated with Rhône Capital would acquire a 40% ownership stake in OFI at an enterprise value of NOK 15.5 billion
mynewsdesk.com
bakingbiscuit.com
. This deal, completed by the end of 2023, unlocked substantial value from OFI (bakery and ice cream ingredient business) and provided capital that Orkla can redeploy into core brand expansions. It also signaled a new approach where Orkla can monetize parts of its portfolio companies while still retaining control. Additionally, Orkla continued its divestment of non-core units: one key sale was Lilleborg, the supplier of professional cleaning products and hygiene solutions (detergents for the institutional market). Orkla agreed in 2023 to sell Lilleborg to Solenis (a US-based specialty chemicals firm), and this sale was completed in early 2024
s29.q4cdn.com
. Lilleborg, while a historic Orkla business, was focused on B2B markets and was deemed outside Orkla’s branded consumer focus. The proceeds and any future earn-outs from such sales contribute to Orkla’s strategy to simplify and focus. By the end of 2023, Orkla had also advanced processes to divest its Hydro Power assets and Pierre Robert Group (a Nordic textiles/clothing brand) – these transactions were slated to close in 2024–2025
orkla.com
orkla.com
. These moves collectively demonstrate Orkla’s commitment to concentrating on its core: branded consumer goods and related businesses where it sees long-term growth potential.
Financial Performance and Pricing: Despite a difficult economic backdrop (sluggish growth and high inflation in many markets), Orkla’s portfolio companies delivered strong financial results in 2023. In the third quarter, for instance, Orkla’s revenues jumped 14%, primarily due to price increases and favorable currency rates
mynewsdesk.com
. Notably, 8 out of 12 portfolio companies achieved underlying profit growth in that quarter
mynewsdesk.com
. In the second quarter, an even more impressive 11 of 12 companies improved profits
mynewsdesk.com
. These improvements were largely driven by the price hikes Orkla had implemented to combat inflation, combined with cost-saving measures and some easing of raw material costs later in the year. While volumes in certain categories were under pressure (as consumers felt the squeeze of inflation), Orkla’s broad product range and strong brand positions allowed it to weather volume declines in some areas and make up for them in others. The company also benefited from currency translation gains, as a weaker Norwegian krone increased the reported NOK results of its foreign subsidiaries
mynewsdesk.com
. By year-end 2023, Orkla’s EBIT (adj.) for consolidated portfolio companies was up significantly, reflecting improved margins after the successful pass-through of costs. The new operating model likely contributed to this performance by enabling faster decision-making (e.g., each portfolio company could adjust pricing and promotions quickly in response to local market conditions).
Strategic Clarity and Future Plans: At Orkla’s Capital Markets Day in November 2023, management presented the new financial targets for the group. Orkla set an ambition for an annual Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of 12–14% for the coming years
mynewsdesk.com
, indicating a combination of profit growth and dividends/buybacks to reward investors. Each portfolio company also has tailored goals for organic growth and profit margin improvement through 2026. The message was that Orkla, as an investment company, will ensure its businesses are benchmark leaders in their fields or take necessary actions (like restructuring or ownership changes) if they underperform. The establishment of external boards for major units (for example, Orkla Foods Europe got a new external Chair and board in late 2023) reinforces governance and strategic oversight at the portfolio-company level
mynewsdesk.com
. In terms of ESG and innovation, Orkla in 2023 kept up momentum: it rolled out more environmentally friendly products (like biodegradable packaging for toiletries, plant-based food innovations, etc.) and invested in capacity for growth areas (for instance, a new vegan food factory in Sweden and automation upgrades in several plants). By the end of 2023, Orkla had largely achieved what it set out to do post-2022: it became a nimbler organization of distinct businesses, showed that those businesses could perform well (even in a tough climate), and positioned itself to pursue growth with a sharper strategic focus.
2024
Refining the Portfolio (Divestments Completed): In 2024, Orkla’s transformation reached a new milestone with the completion of key divestments that were set in motion the year prior. Early in the year, Orkla finalized the sale of Lilleborg (its institutional cleaning products arm) to Solenis, fully exiting that B2B chemicals segment
s29.q4cdn.com
. Moreover, Orkla entered into definitive agreements to divest its Hydro Power portfolio (a collection of hydropower plants in Norway) and the Pierre Robert Group (a Nordic textile and underwear business). These transactions – marking Orkla’s exit from the energy production and fashion apparel fields – were announced in 2024 and are scheduled to close by early 2025
orkla.com
. Once executed, Orkla will have shed essentially all its remaining non-branded-goods activities. The company will then be almost entirely focused on its dozen portfolio companies in the food, snacks, confectionery, health, personal care, and consumer durables sectors. This represents the culmination of Orkla’s long-term strategy to simplify and concentrate its portfolio.
Managing Uncertain Markets: The operating environment in 2024 has been characterized by economic and geopolitical uncertainty, including lingering inflation and cautious consumer sentiment. Orkla has navigated these challenges by leveraging the agility of its portfolio companies. Each business, with greater autonomy, has been able to tailor pricing, product mixes, and marketing to local conditions. By mid-2024, input cost inflation showed signs of moderating (commodity prices like edible oils and certain grains have come off their 2022 peaks), which helped ease margin pressure. However, higher interest rates and other inflationary after-effects have made consumers more value-conscious. Orkla’s companies responded by launching more value packs, promotional offers, and affordable product ranges to maintain volumes. At the same time, they continued to take selective price increases in markets or categories still facing high cost levels, albeit at a slower pace than in 2022–23. Overall, Orkla has managed to stabilize its margins, as the hefty price increases from the prior year fully annualized and cost-saving initiatives bore fruit.
Improving Performance and Synergies: The new portfolio structure has started to yield performance benefits. Orkla reported that in the first half of 2024, a majority of its portfolio companies showed year-on-year profit growth, building on the momentum from 2023. Notably, 11 out of 12 portfolio companies reported profit improvement in Q2 2024, indicating broad-based progress
mynewsdesk.com
. This improvement has come from a mix of factors: the easing of input costs, the effect of earlier pricing actions, and internal efficiency programs (e.g., Orkla Foods Europe implemented leaner manufacturing processes and Orkla Confectionery & Snacks optimized its product assortment to focus on best-sellers). Additionally, synergies between businesses have been explored more openly under the new model; for instance, Orkla’s various food companies have increased collaboration in product development (sharing innovations across markets), and Orkla Care has combined distribution of its health products with the online channels gained from HSNG to boost sales. The company also benefited from positive currency effects due to a relatively weak Norwegian krone in early 2024, which enhanced the NOK value of foreign profits.
Strategic Outlook: In 2024, Orkla’s management and board (now under Chairman Stein Erik Hagen’s active influence) have been articulating a vision for growth 2024–2026. They target a 12–14% annual total shareholder return for Orkla ASA, which implies robust earnings growth and a competitive dividend
mynewsdesk.com
. Each portfolio company has its own strategic plan: for example, Orkla Foods is focusing on healthier and more convenient meal products to drive growth, Orkla Consumer Investments is expanding its pizza franchise concept into new regions (New York Pizza has begun franchising in Germany and Belgium), and Orkla Health is investing in new supplement innovations and possible geographic expansion in Eastern Europe. The capital structure is also being optimized – proceeds from the hydro power sale (expected in late 2024) will likely be used to reduce debt and possibly fund strategic acquisitions in core areas. Orkla has signaled that while large acquisitions are not the immediate priority (given the focus on organic growth and integration), it remains open to “value-accretive investments” where it sees a strong fit
marketscreener.com

.
Conclusion of the Timeline: By the end of 2024, Orkla stands as a markedly different company than it was in 2007. It has transformed from a diversified conglomerate with investments in aluminum, chemicals, solar, media, etc., into a focused branded consumer goods enterprise – albeit one operating as an industrial investment company with a portfolio of autonomous businesses. Over this 18-year timeline, Orkla navigated global recessions, commodity cycles, and a pandemic, while continuously reshaping its portfolio. It capitalized on qualitative performance drivers like strong local brand equity, adaptability to consumer trends (health, sustainability, convenience), strategic M&A, and cost management. As Orkla moves beyond 2024, it will leverage these strengths in an environment where it must remain agile amid ongoing economic uncertainties. The company’s main growth drivers going forward will likely be innovation, geographic expansion of core brands, and active portfolio management, all built on the solid foundation laid from 2007 through 2024. Orkla’s journey exemplifies how a long-established company can reinvent itself to stay ahead in changing times, focusing on its core mission of delivering branded products that “meet consumer needs and create everyday value,” even as the world around it continues to evolve.
