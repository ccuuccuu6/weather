. These moves expanded CCH’s product offerings beyond traditional soft drinks.
Sustainability recognition: Earned inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the first time
coca-colahellenic.com
, signaling growing acknowledgement of Coca-Cola HBC’s corporate responsibility efforts.
Onset of global recession pressures: The late-2008 financial crisis began to impact the business. Sharp rises in commodity and input costs early in the year and a sudden downturn in consumer spending in key markets by year-end created headwinds
annualreports.com
. Coca-Cola HBC responded by emphasizing efficiency and affordability as consumer confidence started to wane.
2009
Navigating the global recession: 2009 was one of the most difficult years in the company’s history as the economic downturn hit nearly all markets
annualreports.com
. Consumer demand fell and volume declined (~2% drop) after years of growth, but Coca-Cola HBC leveraged its broad geographic footprint to mitigate the impact – softer sales in Western Europe were partly offset by more resilient emerging markets
annualreports.com
.
Cost control and restructuring: Proactively managed costs and productivity to preserve profitability. The company streamlined production, distribution and marketing expenses, doubled free cash flow from 2008 levels, and significantly reduced working capital needs
annualreports.com
annualreports.com
. These efficiency measures freed up resources to continue investing in brands and marketplace execution despite the downturn.
Continued focus on sustainability: Even amid the crisis, Coca-Cola HBC remained committed to sustainable growth. It rolled out new combined heat and power (CHP) plants (3 of 16 planned CHPs began operating, cutting CO₂ emissions by ~20%) and retrofitted coolers for energy savings
annualreports.com
annualreports.com
. The company’s sustainability leadership was recognized as it ranked among the top 10% of companies in the 2009 DJSI, with the world’s highest environmental score in the beverage industry

2010
Economic recovery and renewed growth: Signs of recovery appeared in 2010, especially in Eastern Europe. Declining unemployment and rising incomes in markets like Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus (notably in the second half) boosted consumer confidence and spending
annualreports.com
. Coca-Cola HBC returned to volume growth (e.g. high-single-digit volume gains in Ukraine and Russia), although some countries with government austerity (e.g. Greece, Hungary) remained fragile
annualreports.com
annualreports.com
.
Market execution and product launches: The company invested in aggressive marketing to capture recovering demand. It conducted one of its largest-ever sampling campaigns for Coca-Cola in Russia (reaching ~5 million consumers)
annualreports.com
, introduced new product innovations like functional juices (e.g. Fresh&Co’s neXt range for health-conscious consumers), and launched localized flavors (such as Rosa flavoured water in Serbia) to re-engage consumers. These efforts helped Coca-Cola HBC regain market share and momentum post-crisis.
Ongoing efficiency and infrastructure projects: Continued focus on productivity and sustainability — for example, Coca-Cola HBC light-weighted its PET bottles (e.g. making Serbia’s Rosa water and Bulgaria’s Bankya water bottles among the lightest in its system) to save materials, and neared completion of wastewater treatment plants for all production sites to meet environmental goals. The company’s leaner cost base and improved supply chain set the stage for profitable growth as the economy normalized.
2011
Growth amid challenges: Despite Europe’s brewing debt crisis, Coca-Cola HBC achieved growth in 2011 by focusing on value over volume. It grew revenue faster than volumes, indicating successful pricing/mix improvements, and maintained or expanded market leadership in sparkling drinks in 25 of its 28 countries – a testament to strong marketplace execution. However, Southern Europe’s woes (Greek and Italian recessions) still weighed on consumer demand, partially offset by better trends in emerging markets.
Operational excellence: All manufacturing plants across the group achieved ISO 9001 quality certification in 2011, underscoring the company’s focus on high operational standards
coca-colahellenic.com

2012
Eurozone crisis impact and response: 2012 saw weak consumer demand in debt-laden European markets and high input costs squeeze performance
reuters.com
. Greece – Coca-Cola HBC’s home market – was especially hard-hit by austerity: soft drink sales plunged amid soaring unemployment and a VAT hike on beverages (from 13% to 23%). In response, CCH implemented tough efficiency measures, closing two production lines in Greece (Thessaloniki and Patras) to consolidate operations and cut costs as local volume had dropped ~23% since 2008

.
Corporate reorganization for stability: Amid the turmoil, management took bold steps to redomicile the company. In autumn 2012, Coca-Cola Hellenic announced it would shift its primary stock listing from Athens to London and incorporate a new holding company in Switzerland
latimes.com
. The aim was to tap a more stable economic environment, enhance liquidity and access to capital, and reduce exposure to Greek market risk. This strategic move — essentially “jumping ship” from crisis-hit Greece — positioned the company for future growth under a more secure footing. (This reorganization was executed in 2013.)
Continued diversification: Despite macro challenges, Coca-Cola HBC kept broadening its portfolio. It introduced new low-calorie products and affordable package formats to appeal to cost-conscious consumers, and prepared to launch the Monster Energy brand (after The Coca-Cola Company’s investment in Monster) to capture opportunities in the fast-growing energy drink segment (distribution agreements for Monster were initiated, setting the stage for a 2015–2016 rollout).
2013
LSE listing and new era: Coca-Cola HBC completed its transformation into a Swiss-based company. In April 2013, Coca-Cola HBC AG debuted on the London Stock Exchange’s premium segment and was quickly included in the FTSE 100 index
examples.integratedreporting.ifrs.org
. This milestone enhanced the company’s visibility among global investors and optimized its access to equity and debt markets. Coca-Cola HBC’s relocation to “stable ground” was symbolic of Greece’s largest company seeking insulation from the Eurozone crisis.
Resilient performance in tough markets: 2013 remained challenging in many territories – consumer confidence and disposable incomes were depressed in a majority of markets, leading to pressure on sales volumes
examples.integratedreporting.ifrs.org
. Despite this, Coca-Cola HBC delivered improved operating profit and margin. It achieved this by stringent cost control (centralizing services in low-cost hubs, cross-border production synergies) which actually increased operating margins for the first time in years
examples.integratedreporting.ifrs.org
. Working capital was also optimized (turning net working capital negative), bolstering cash flow.
Marketing wins and share gains: The company continued to execute its “Play to Win” strategy. It rolled out popular marketing initiatives like the personalized “Share a Coke” campaign (which boosted single-serve sales)
examples.integratedreporting.ifrs.org
. Sparkling beverages remained the top priority – Coca-Cola HBC achieved all-time-high Coke volume share in 15 markets in 2013
examples.integratedreporting.ifrs.org
. It also grew or maintained overall non-alcoholic drink value share in the majority of countries, even introducing successful new products such as Cappy Pulpy (a juicy soft drink) to drive future growth
examples.integratedreporting.ifrs.org
.
Footprint optimization: Under its cost leadership agenda, Coca-Cola HBC aggressively streamlined infrastructure. Since 2008 it had reduced the number of plants in developed markets by 32% and invested in new mega-plants for efficiency
examples.integratedreporting.ifrs.org
. In 2013, for example, it opened a state-of-the-art juice facility in Romania to supply seven neighboring countries
examples.integratedreporting.ifrs.org
. Such moves, along with further buildup of the Sofia shared service center and centralized procurement, helped the company leverage scale for competitive input pricing
examples.integratedreporting.ifrs.org
. By year-end, Coca-Cola HBC had built a stronger, leaner platform poised to benefit as trading conditions would improve.
2014
Geopolitical and currency headwinds: 2014 brought volatile external conditions. Russia, Coca-Cola HBC’s largest market, slid into stagnation as Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis and a plunging ruble hurt the economy. Russian consumer spending on Coke products fell sharply amid these pressures
reuters.com
. The ruble’s depreciation squeezed the company’s reported results and forced it to trim its cash flow targets
reuters.com
.
Adaptive strategy in Russia: To counteract the slump, Coca-Cola HBC made portfolio moves. Notably, it acquired a new juice brand in Russia, which helped volumes resume growth by Q4 2014
reuters.com
. Indeed, despite the year’s early declines (group volume was down nearly 4% in the first nine months), a strong fourth quarter rebound — aided by the juice acquisition and improved execution — lifted full-year sales volume to a slight increase of +0.8%
reuters.com
. This demonstrated agility in a tough market.
Signs of recovery elsewhere: Some European markets began stabilizing. Greece registered its first volume growth since 2008, with a 2% rise in sales as the Greek economy showed tentative recovery
reuters.com
. Similarly, other countries that had been struggling saw consumer confidence improve modestly. Coca-Cola HBC remained cautious but optimistic as these fragile economies emerged from recession.
Commodity relief and cost actions: Late 2014’s oil price crash provided a silver lining – lower PET plastic and fuel costs started to benefit the cost of goods
reuters.com
. The company also undertook pricing actions to mitigate currency weaknesses and inflation in various markets
reuters.com
. Internally, Coca-Cola HBC intensified cost management to protect margins in the face of headwinds.
Sustainability achievement: In 2014 Coca-Cola HBC earned its first-ever “A” rating from CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) for climate-change disclosure and performance
coca-colahellenic.com
. This top score reflected significant strides in reducing emissions and improving environmental management, further cementing its reputation as a sustainability leader.
2015
Broad-based growth returns: 2015 marked a year of strong volume and profit growth for CCH. After several lean years, volumes increased in all three segments (Established, Developing, Emerging) with particularly robust trends in emerging markets. This was achieved despite one major headwind – Russia’s economy contracted significantly in 2015 and the ruble remained weak, creating a challenging backdrop in CCH’s largest territory
coca-colahellenic.com
. To offset Russia’s difficulties, the company drove growth in other markets (for example, Nigeria and Romania saw solid volume gains) and implemented targeted initiatives in Russia to stabilize performance.
Record margins through efficiency: Management’s discipline in cost control paid off. Coca-Cola HBC leveraged years of productivity efforts to mitigate currency headwinds and keep input costs in check
coca-colahellenic.com
. As a result, 2015 operating profit margins were the highest since before the 2008 global crisis
coca-colahellenic.com
. The company’s focus on reducing overhead, optimizing logistics, and hedging currencies helped protect profitability even as it invested for growth.
Portfolio evolution and health trends: With consumers increasingly health-conscious, Coca-Cola HBC broadened its offerings. It significantly expanded low- and no-sugar options and launched smaller pack sizes. The company also secured distribution of the Monster Energy range, following The Coca-Cola Company’s mid-2015 acquisition of a stake in Monster. By late 2015, CCH was rolling out Monster Energy in multiple markets (fully implemented in 20 countries by 2016)
ro.coca-colahellenic.com
. Additionally, Coca-Cola HBC’s continued efforts in community well-being (investing €4 million in active-lifestyle programs) and environmental targets earned it recognition as the world’s most sustainable beverage company on the 2015 DJSI for a second consecutive year
coca-colahellenic.com
coca-colahellenic.com
. In short, 2015 was a turning point year with a return to growth, driven by portfolio diversification and relentless operational focus.
2016
Strategic partnerships and acquisitions: In 2016 Coca-Cola HBC moved further beyond traditional soft drinks. It forged a major new partnership with Gruppo Campari, starting to distribute spirits like Campari, Aperol and Grand Marnier in its territories (initially launching in Greece and expanding to 15 markets)
coca-colahellenic.com
. It also acquired Neptūnas mineral water in Lithuania, strengthening its premium water portfolio in the Baltics
coca-colahellenic.com
. These moves tapped into higher-value segments (alcoholic beverages and water) and leveraged CCH’s distribution network.
Capitalizing on energy drinks: Following the Monster Energy deal, 2016 was the first full year CCH carried the Monster brand across many countries. The energy category performed well (double-digit growth in Europe
ro.coca-colahellenic.com
), and adding Monster alongside Coke’s own Burn energy drink gave Coca-Cola HBC a “wider energy portfolio” to capture this fast-growing segment
ro.coca-colahellenic.com
. The company aggressively marketed these beverages to meet youth lifestyle trends and gained market share in energy drinks.
Mixed economic climate: Macroeconomic conditions varied. Western Europe saw moderate growth and low inflation, boosting consumer sentiment, while certain emerging markets struggled. Notably Nigeria fell into recession in 2016 due to the oil price crash, with high inflation after a currency devaluation. Coca-Cola HBC navigated these challenges by tailoring strategies locally – for example, in Nigeria it adjusted pricing and pack sizes to preserve affordability. Meanwhile, Russia’s economy stabilized compared to 2015, helping volumes there to improve. Overall, the company managed a balance of growth (Central/Eastern Europe) and volatility (parts of Africa) through pricing strategy and cost focus.
Efficiency and digitalization: The ongoing “Fit for Future” efficiency program delivered further savings in 2016. Coca-Cola HBC also began investing in digital capabilities – such as piloting data analytics for route optimization and rolling out a new ERP module (SAP Wave 2) to more countries – aimed at driving future productivity. By the end of 2016, the company had built a strong foundation to continue adapting successfully to change in a dynamic market environment.
2017
Leadership transition: Longtime CEO Dimitris Lois tragically passed away in 2017. In December, Zoran Bogdanović was appointed CEO, ensuring continuity and a seamless transition in leadership
coca-colahellenic.com
. Bogdanović, a company veteran, reaffirmed Coca-Cola HBC’s strategic priorities and focus on execution, carrying forward the trajectory set under Lois.
Expansion into premium spirits: Coca-Cola HBC doubled down on its spirits strategy. It acquired Rézangyal, a well-known premium pálinka (fruit brandy) brand in Hungary, and MB Impex in Serbia, producer of local liqueurs and brandy
coca-colahellenic.com
. These acquisitions bolstered CCH’s premium spirits portfolio in Central Europe, allowing it to participate in local spirits categories alongside its core beer and wine mixers business. By adding alcoholic beverages, Coca-Cola HBC aimed to capture more “share of throat” and leverage synergies with its soft drinks in bars and restaurants (for example, selling Coca-Cola mixers with purchased spirits).
Solid market performance: 2017 saw improved economic conditions in many of CCH’s markets – Europe’s economy grew at its fastest pace in a decade. Coca-Cola HBC benefited from this favorable backdrop with broad-based volume growth, especially in carbonated soft drinks and water. The company also innovated in the low/no sugar segment (reformulating and re-launching Coca-Cola Zero Sugar in several markets in 2017) to adapt to consumer health trends. Additionally, with impending sugar taxes in some countries, CCH shifted its mix toward reduced-sugar beverages. These actions helped drive volume and value growth while preparing for regulatory changes.
Awards and sustainability: Coca-Cola HBC’s achievements continued to earn recognition. In 2017, it was named Europe’s most sustainable beverage company on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 4th time in five years, reflecting ongoing leadership in areas like carbon reduction, water conservation, and community programs. The company’s sustainability agenda – now well-integrated into its growth strategy – remained a key pillar as it moved into 2018.
2018
Diversifying into new categories: In 2018, Coca-Cola HBC made several high-profile product launches to address shifting consumer preferences. It introduced FUZETEA, a ready-to-drink iced tea, across 27 of its European markets in one of the largest new product rollouts to date
coca-colahellenic.com
. It also launched AdeZ, a plant-based dairy-alternative beverage (made from seeds and nuts), in 13 markets
coca-colahellenic.com
 – marking the company’s entry into the plant-based drink category to cater to vegan and health-conscious consumers. In addition, CCH expanded Royal Bliss premium mixers (crafted tonics and mixers for cocktails) into its territories
coca-colahellenic.com
, aiming to capture the growing trend of premium mixology. These launches demonstrated Coca-Cola HBC’s commitment to growing a 24/7 beverage portfolio well beyond sparkling sodas.
World Without Waste initiative: Coca-Cola HBC embraced The Coca-Cola Company’s “World Without Waste” global packaging strategy announced in 2018
coca-colahellenic.com
. The company committed to ambitious 2025/2030 targets for packaging recycling and recovery – for instance, aiming to help collect the equivalent of 100% of its packaging and use 50% recycled material in PET bottles by 2030. Implementation began with consumer campaigns on recycling, investments in recycling facilities, and introducing more recyclable packaging designs. This sustainability push was both an environmental responsibility and a strategic response to consumer and regulatory pressures about plastic waste.
Strong operating results: 2018 was a year of robust performance for Coca-Cola HBC. Favorable economic conditions (low unemployment, rising wages) in many key markets boosted consumer spending on beverages. The company saw particularly strong growth in the sparkling category and water. It gained market share in non-alcoholic drinks in most of its countries as its strategy of revenue growth through price/mix optimization continued to pay off. However, it also navigated new challenges like the introduction of sugar taxes in some jurisdictions (e.g. Ireland and the UK introduced soft drink levies in April 2018). To mitigate impact, Coca-Cola HBC had proactively expanded its low/no sugar options and promoted smaller pack sizes – as a result, it maintained sales momentum even as consumers adjusted to sugar-tax-driven price increases. Overall, 2018’s balanced growth across product lines and markets reflected the success of the company’s diversified approach.
Recognition: Coca-Cola HBC’s consistency earned it Europe’s #1 sustainable beverage company title on DJSI for the fifth time in six years. It also received a double “A” rating from CDP for climate and water – a rare honor underlining leadership in environmental performance

.
2019
M&A and portfolio breadth: 2019 was marked by strategic acquisitions as Coca-Cola HBC ventured beyond beverages into snacking. It acquired Bambi, Serbia’s leading confectionery company known for biscuits and wafers, entering the sweet snacks market
coca-colahellenic.com
. CCH also bought Italy’s Lurisia, a premium natural mineral water and craft soda brand, adding an upscale water with strong heritage to its Italian portfolio
coca-colahellenic.com
. In the Czech Republic, it acquired Toma, a local water and juice brand, to strengthen its position in still beverages
coca-colahellenic.com
. These acquisitions reflected a push into high-value segments (premium water, confections) complementary to its core drinks business, and offered new revenue streams and cross-selling opportunities.
New product launches: Coca-Cola HBC continued to refresh its product lineup. Notably, it launched Coca-Cola Energy – the first energy drink under the Coke brand – across 15 countries in 2019
coca-colahellenic.com
, leveraging Coca-Cola’s brand power to grab a share of the booming energy drink market. The company also piloted **augmented reality “picking glasses” in its warehouses in Greece

Additionally, 2019 saw the introduction of the group’s new strategic plan “Growth Story 2025”, outlining its vision for the next 5 years focused on portfolio expansion, digital commerce, and sustainability
coca-colahellenic.com
.
Packaging innovation and sustainability: In 2019 Coca-Cola HBC accelerated its sustainable packaging initiatives. It rolled out 100% recycled PET bottles for four of its water brands (Valser, Römerquelle, Deep RiverRock, and Dorna) in select markets
coca-colahellenic.com
 – a significant step toward circular packaging. It also partnered with The Coca-Cola Company to introduce KeelClip™, a new paperboard packaging for multi-pack cans (replacing plastic shrink wrap) – the first such innovation in the non-alcoholic drinks industry in Europe
coca-colahellenic.com
. These efforts earned CCH recognition as Europe’s most sustainable beverage company on DJSI yet again (for the 6th time in 7 years)
coca-colahellenic.com
. All 31 of its European plants achieved top-tier water stewardship certification by 2019 as well
coca-colahellenic.com
, highlighting progress on environmental goals.
Strong financial performance: Backed by new products, acquisitions, and generally favorable economic conditions, Coca-Cola HBC delivered solid growth in 2019. It saw volume and revenue gains in both emerging and established markets. For example, Nigeria and Russia posted improved results, and even some mature markets in Western Europe grew thanks to innovation and premiumization. By the end of 2019, Coca-Cola HBC was firing on all cylinders – ready to face the upcoming challenges of 2020 with a more diversified and future-ready business.
2020
COVID-19 pandemic impact: The year 2020 was dominated by the global COVID-19 crisis, which posed unprecedented challenges. With lockdowns and social distancing measures, away-from-home sales (restaurants, cafes, entertainment venues) collapsed for a period, especially in Q2. Coca-Cola HBC saw significant volume declines in the out-of-home channels and had to quickly adapt to a surge in at-home consumption (e.g. larger multipack sales through supermarkets). The company took swift action to ensure safety of employees (PPE, distancing in plants) and maintained supply chain continuity despite disruptions.
Community support and resilience: Coca-Cola HBC actively supported its communities and front-line responders during the pandemic. In partnership with The Coca-Cola Company and The Coca-Cola Foundation, CCH contributed over $6 million in grants and donated 5 million liters of beverages to health workers and vulnerable groups across its markets
coca-colahellenic.com
. This effort not only provided relief but also kept the brands engaged with consumers. By year-end, the company’s agile response – including refocusing on off-premise, pushing e-commerce, and tightly managing costs – helped it weather the worst of the pandemic.
Continued innovation (in a muted market): Despite the crisis, Coca-Cola HBC proceeded with strategic product launches. It began rolling out Costa Coffee in several markets (starting with at-home consumption formats) as part of Coca-Cola’s newly acquired coffee business
coca-colahellenic.com
. It also introduced Topo Chico Hard Seltzer (a new alcoholic sparkling water beverage) in 5 countries
coca-colahellenic.com
, entering the trendy hard seltzer category at an early stage. These initiatives, though on a smaller scale due to pandemic constraints, set the groundwork for post-COVID growth in categories beyond traditional soda.
Recognition and sustainability: In 2020, Coca-Cola HBC was proud to be ranked the world’s most sustainable beverage company on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) – a testament to its long-term ESG efforts
coca-colahellenic.com
. The company also achieved Alliance for Water Stewardship certification at 52 plants (100% of its operations), underscoring its commitment to water conservation even amid operational challenges
coca-colahellenic.com
. These accolades provided a bright spot in an otherwise difficult year. By the end of 2020, while volumes and profits were down due to the pandemic, Coca-Cola HBC had proven its resilience and was poised to rebound as markets reopened.
2021
Post-pandemic recovery: As vaccination campaigns rolled out and economies reopened, 2021 saw a strong rebound in demand for Coca-Cola HBC. Markets like Russia, Nigeria, and Central Europe experienced double-digit volume recoveries, and the out-of-home channels (cafes, bars, hotels) began bouncing back. The company navigated supply chain issues (global logistics bottlenecks) and higher input costs (commodity inflation for PET, aluminum, sugar) that emerged in late 2021, using hedging and pricing strategies to cushion the impact. Overall, CCH restored its sales to roughly pre-pandemic levels, with a favorable mix as consumers gravitated to premium products and multi-packs for home.
Expansion in coffee segment: Building on its entry into coffee via Costa, Coca-Cola HBC took a 30% stake in Caffè Vergnano, a premium Italian coffee roaster, in 2021
coca-colahellenic.com
. This partnership brought an authentic high-end coffee portfolio (beans and capsules) into its offering. It complemented Costa Coffee’s more mainstream appeal and signaled CCH’s intent to become a major player in coffee across its markets (spanning retail and HoReCa distribution). By year-end, CCH was selling coffee solutions (machines and products) to many of its food-service customers, creating a new revenue stream aligned with evolving consumer tastes.
Net zero commitment: In 2021 Coca-Cola HBC announced an ambitious pledge to achieve net zero emissions across its entire value chain by 2040
coca-colahellenic.com
. This commitment covers not only direct operations but also value-chain partners (ingredients, packaging, transportation). The company laid out plans to invest in climate-friendly technologies, increase recycled content in packaging, switch to green energy, and work with suppliers on carbon reduction. This strategic goal was well-received by investors and stakeholders, reinforcing CCH’s image as a sustainability front-runner.
Other sustainability milestones: Coca-Cola HBC’s Nigerian operations (NBC) achieved Alliance for Water Stewardship Gold certification for all its plants – a first in Africa
coca-colahellenic.com
. The company also continued lightweighting packaging and expanding collection programs. For its efforts, it remained among the top-rated global beverage firms on indices like DJSI and CDP. By the end of 2021, Coca-Cola HBC had not only recovered from the pandemic slump but was also pushing into new categories (coffee) and setting long-term ESG benchmarks that would guide its future strategy.
2022
War in Ukraine and business adaptation: The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 had significant implications for Coca-Cola HBC. The company has sizable operations in both countries. Immediately, ensuring employee safety and humanitarian support became the priority – CCH provided aid and support to affected employees and communities. The conflict and ensuing Western sanctions forced Coca-Cola HBC to drastically adjust its Russian business. The Coca-Cola Company suspended brand sales in Russia, meaning CCH had to halt production of Coke, Fanta, etc., in Russia by mid-2022. In response, Coca-Cola HBC established a “new local, self-sufficient model” for its Russian subsidiary Multon (a juice business)
coca-colahellenic.com
. Essentially, the Russian unit pivoted to local brands (like Dobry, Rich juices and a locally formulated cola) and operated independently from the Coca-Cola system for concentrates. This restructuring allowed the Russian affiliate to continue trading (focused on juices and other non-trademark drinks) while complying with sanctions – though it significantly shrank CCH’s involvement in Russia. Ukraine operations were severely disrupted by the war (production was paused in conflict zones), though the company managed to supply the market intermittently from plants in safer areas or neighboring countries.
Inflation and input cost surge: 2022 saw historic inflation across many of Coca-Cola HBC’s markets – energy prices, PET resin, aluminum, and sugar costs all spiked (partly fallout from the war). This created a squeeze on profitability. CCH responded with multiple price increases throughout the year and intensified cost-saving initiatives (factory efficiencies, value engineering for packaging, etc.). It also temporarily reduced marketing spend in some markets to offset higher costs. While margins were under pressure, these actions helped protect the business and enabled Coca-Cola HBC to finish the year with only a modest decline in operating profit despite the extraordinary headwinds.
Resilient demand and portfolio focus: Consumer demand remained robust in most of CCH’s territories despite inflation – aided by the post-COVID reopening effect. The company saw growth in categories like energy drinks, sports drinks, and premium mixers as consumers returned to socializing. It doubled down on its 24/7 portfolio strategy, ensuring availability of a beverage for every occasion (from morning coffee to evening cocktails). Notably, early 2022 Coca-Cola HBC completed the acquisition of Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Egypt, expanding its footprint in Africa
coca-colahellenic.com
. Egypt brought a high-growth market of 100 million people into the group, with opportunities in sparkling drinks, juice, and water. Integration efforts proceeded through 2022, with CCH sharing best practices in distribution and cold-drink equipment with the Egyptian bottler.
Performance: Given the loss of revenue from Russia (previously ~10% of volume) and cost inflation, 2022 was challenging. Nonetheless, strong growth in other markets (like Nigeria, Poland, Italy) and the addition of Egypt helped offset some of the shortfall. Coca-Cola HBC’s diversified geographic portfolio proved valuable – as Central/Eastern Europe faced war-related disruptions, its Nigerian and Western European businesses thrived due to reopening and favorable demographics. By year-end, while overall volume was down (excluding new acquisitions) due to Russia/Ukraine, underlying demand remained healthy and the company had demonstrated agility in crisis management.
2023
Premium spirits acquisition – Finlandia: In 2023, Coca-Cola HBC made a significant move in alcohol by acquiring the global rights to Finlandia Vodka from Brown-Forman
coca-colahellenic.com
. Finlandia is a premium vodka brand with good international presence. Owning Finlandia outright (rather than just distributing it) gave CCH a strong cornerstone in the premium spirits category and opportunities for higher-margin growth. The brand fit well with CCH’s push for “mixability” – combining its non-alcoholic drinks (Coke, Schweppes mixers, etc.) with owned alcohol brands. Following the acquisition, CCH began integrating Finlandia into its network, aiming to expand distribution and capitalize on cross-selling in bars and supermarkets.
Top-line momentum: 2023 was a year of robust growth for Coca-Cola HBC. As inflation started to ease in many markets, the company was able to accelerate volume growth. It gained significant market share, with Nielsen naming Coca-Cola HBC the #1 contributor to retail value growth in the FMCG sector for its markets
coca-colahellenic.com
. Essentially, CCH drove more retail sales growth for customers than any other supplier, thanks to its strong portfolio performance. Categories like energy drinks, ready-to-drink coffee, and premium water led the way. Meanwhile, the recovery of the hospitality sector meant high-margin single-serve sales (small bottles/cans for immediate consumption) grew strongly.
Sustainability leadership: Coca-Cola HBC’s consistent ESG focus kept it at the top of industry rankings. In 2023, it was ranked again as the world’s most sustainable beverage company by DJSI – the seventh time it earned that honor
coca-colahellenic.com
. Key achievements included increased use of recycled PET, further reductions in water use, and progress toward its 2040 net-zero goal (e.g. introducing electric trucks in some fleets, installing solar panels at facilities). The company’s sustainability initiatives are not just CSR, but also drive cost savings (energy, materials) and brand goodwill.
Continued growth investments: Besides Finlandia, CCH invested in capabilities for future growth. It ramped up digital commerce platforms, enabling direct-to-consumer delivery pilots in some cities. It also expanded production capacity for its fastest-growing products (e.g. new canning lines for energy drinks in Poland). Recognizing the importance of analytics, Coca-Cola HBC used data-driven tools to optimize pricing and promotions in the high-inflation environment. By the end of 2023, the company had largely absorbed the shock of the Russia/Ukraine exit and was delivering growth above pre-pandemic levels. It entered 2024 as a stronger, more diversified enterprise – with alcohol, coffee, premium mixers and plant-based drinks now meaningful parts of the business alongside core sparkling beverages.
2024
Sustained strong performance: In 2024, Coca-Cola HBC continued its trajectory of high-quality growth. The company achieved roughly +3% volume growth and +14% revenue growth organically, reflecting both higher sales and effective pricing (to cover remaining inflation)

. It saw growth across a range of macroeconomic conditions – from stable Western European economies to more volatile emerging markets – demonstrating agility and local-market expertise. Critically, strategic priority categories led the growth: the energy drinks segment, ready-to-drink coffee, premium water, and spirits all outpaced traditional soda, validating the 24/7 portfolio strategy.
Leading the market: For the second year running, Coca-Cola HBC was recognized as the number one contributor to retail customers’ revenue growth in Europe’s FMCG industry

. It also continued to gain value share in non-alcoholic beverages in most markets in 2024

, even excluding the Russian business. These gains were driven by strong in-market execution, effective marketing campaigns, and leveraging its broad distribution reach. The Coca-Cola brand performed robustly (helped by marketing around events like the FIFA World Cup in late 2022 carrying into regional promotions in 2023–24), and smaller brands like Schweppes, AdeZ, and local juices also contributed incremental growth.
Portfolio and capability investments: Throughout 2024, Coca-Cola HBC invested in the future. It devoted significant capex to expand its production capacity in key growth areas (for example, new high-speed bottling lines for water in Nigeria, and additional canning capacity for energy drinks in Italy). It also enhanced its digital sales capabilities, rolling out a revamped B2B ordering platform for retail customers and experimenting with AI-driven demand forecasting. On the sustainability front, 2024 saw Coca-Cola HBC increase its use of recycled PET to nearly 25% of total plastic usage, and it launched several community recycling programs in Africa and Eastern Europe. These moves not only support its ESG goals but also ensure a secure supply of recycled material for the future.
Integration of acquisitions: The Coca-Cola Bottling Egypt business acquired in 2022 was fully integrated by 2024, contributing solid growth as it introduced more Coca-Cola HBC best practices in market execution. Likewise, the Finlandia vodka business (acquired in 2023) was successfully absorbed, with CCH leveraging it in marketing (e.g. promoting cocktails using its mixers and Finlandia). The company used Finlandia to spearhead an emerging “premium spirits & cocktails” segment, which it sees as a growth avenue alongside non-alcoholic drinks.
Preparing for a rebrand: By the end of 2024, Coca-Cola HBC was preparing for a corporate identity refresh (unveiled in early 2025) to rename itself “Hellenic Beverage Company,” signaling its evolution into a diversified total beverage player

. This upcoming rebrand encapsulates the transformation achieved over the 2007–2024 period – from a carbonated soft-drink bottler into a broad beverage partner offering everything from soft drinks and water to coffee, alcohol, juices, and plant-based drinks. Coca-Cola HBC entered 2025 with strong momentum, a flexible business model, and confidence in navigating whatever economic or consumer trends lie ahead.
