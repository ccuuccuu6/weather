Issuing Authority: Trade Remedy and Investigation Bureau
Document No.: Ministry of Commerce Announcement No. 34 of 2025
Date of Issue: July 4, 2025

In accordance with the “Regulations of the People’s Republic of China on Anti-Dumping” (hereinafter the “Anti-Dumping Regulations”), on January 5, 2024 the Ministry of Commerce (hereinafter the “Authority”) published Announcement No. 1 of 2024, deciding to initiate an anti-dumping investigation into certain spirits obtained by distilling grape wine in containers holding less than 200 liters and originating in the European Union (hereinafter the “subject goods” or “brandy”).

The Authority investigated whether the subject goods were being dumped and the margin of any dumping, whether they caused injury or threat of injury to the domestic industry and the degree thereof, and whether there was a causal link between any dumping and any injury or threat of injury. Based on the investigation results and pursuant to Article 24 of the Anti-Dumping Regulations, on August 29, 2024 the Authority issued a preliminary determination, preliminarily finding that the subject brandy imported from the European Union was being dumped, that China’s domestic brandy industry faced a threat of material injury, and that there was a causal relationship between the dumping and the threat of injury.

After the preliminary determination, the Authority continued its investigation into dumping and dumping margins, injury and injury margins, and the causal link between dumping and injury. The investigation has now concluded. In accordance with Article 25 of the Anti-Dumping Regulations, the Authority has reached its final determination (see Attachment 1). The following is hereby announced:

I. Final Determination
The Authority’s final determination is that subject brandy imported from the European Union is being dumped, that China’s domestic brandy industry faces a threat of material injury, and that there is a causal link between the dumping and the threat of injury.

II. Imposition of Anti-Dumping Duties and Price Commitments
Pursuant to Article 38 of the Anti-Dumping Regulations, the Ministry of Commerce has recommended to the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council that anti-dumping duties be imposed. The Customs Tariff Commission, acting on that recommendation, has decided that, as of July 5, 2025, anti-dumping duties shall be imposed on subject brandy imported from the European Union.

Description of the subject goods:

Scope of investigation: Spirits obtained by distilling grape wine in containers holding less than 200 liters, originating in the European Union.

Product name: Spirits obtained by distilling grape wine in containers holding less than 200 liters (commonly called “Brandy”).

English name: “Spirits obtained by distilling grape wine in containers holding less than 200 liters (usually called Brandy).”

Product description: A spirit produced from raw materials such as grapes, grape juice (must), grape pomace, or wine.

Use: Primarily consumed as a beverage alcohol.

Tariff classification: Harmonized System code 2208.20.00 under the Import and Export Tariff of the People’s Republic of China. Note that spirits in containers of 200 liters or more under this code are not within the scope of this investigation.

The anti-dumping duty rates applied to individual companies are listed in Attachment 2.

Following the preliminary determination, certain EU industry associations and companies submitted price-commitment applications to the Authority, which reviewed them. Pursuant to the Anti-Dumping Regulations, the Authority has decided to accept these price commitments (see Attachment 3), which shall enter into force simultaneously with this final determination. During the price-commitment period, imports of subject brandy by these companies at or above the committed prices shall be exempt from anti-dumping duties; if any violation of the price commitment or other grounds for termination of the commitment occur, anti-dumping duties will be applied at the rates set out in the final determination.

III. Calculation Method for Anti-Dumping Duties
From July 5, 2025 onward, importers of subject brandy from the European Union shall pay anti-dumping duties to the customs authorities of the People’s Republic of China. Anti-dumping duties shall be ad valorem, calculated on the customs-appraised value of the imported goods as follows:

Anti-dumping duty amount = Customs-appraised value × Anti-dumping duty rate
Consumption tax on imports shall be calculated ad valorem on the sum of the customs-appraised value, duties (including anti-dumping duties), and a specific-rate component (where applicable), divided by (1 – specific-rate tax rate), and also by the quantity-based specific rate. Value-added tax on imports shall be calculated ad valorem on the sum of the customs-appraised value, duties (including anti-dumping duties), and consumption tax.

IV. Non-Retroactive Application
Anti-dumping duties shall not be retroactively applied to subject brandy imported from October 11, 2024 through July 4, 2025 (inclusive). Any cash deposits or guarantees submitted to customs under Ministry of Commerce Announcement No. 42 of 2024 or No. 50 of 2024 shall be refunded or released in accordance with regulations.

Anti-dumping duties shall not be retroactively applied to subject brandy imported before the imposition of provisional anti-dumping measures.

V. Duration of Duties and Price Commitments
The anti-dumping duties and the price-commitment arrangements shall remain in effect for five years, from July 5, 2025.

VI. New Exporter Reviews
New exporters in the EU that did not export subject brandy to China during the investigation period may, if they meet the conditions, apply in writing to the Authority for a new-exporter review under Article 47 of the Anti-Dumping Regulations.

VII. Interim Reviews
Interested parties may file written requests for interim reviews with the Authority during the period in which duties are in effect, in accordance with Article 49 of the Anti-Dumping Regulations.

VIII. Administrative Reconsideration and Litigation
Those dissatisfied with this final determination or with the decision to impose anti-dumping duties may apply for administrative reconsideration or initiate administrative litigation in accordance with Article 53 of the Anti-Dumping Regulations.

This announcement shall take effect on July 5, 2025.
